</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Billy Whiskers settled in Farmersville he fully expected
to end his days in that quiet little community where he
had a good home, plenty to eat, many friends and enjoyed the reputation
of being the wisest of the animals at Cloverleaf Farm.</p>

<p>Those of you who do not know his earlier adventures had better
read them in the other Billy Whiskers books. There is no time to
tell them now for so much happened at the Circus we shall have to
hurry in order to get through telling about it by the time this book
comes to an end.</p>

<p>Even Billy himself, in after years, when he amused his great
grandchildren with stories of his earlier life, used to say that the day
at the Circus and those that followed were the most exciting and
interesting of all his life; and although he was asked to repeat the
story very often he generally refused, keeping it for special occasions
like birthdays, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving or Christmas. He said
if told too often, it would become an old story and all the kids in time
would begin to regard their grandfather an old bore, just as they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the Mexican parrot who was forever telling the same thing over and
over again. Billy Whiskers, you see, was very wise. He knew that
good stories are just like good clothes or anything else choice, that in
order to keep them good, they must not be brought out every day.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers, many of you remember, was a very remarkable
goat, larger and stronger than others, with a beautiful white coat that
when cleaned and well combed was the color of ivory and shone like
silk. His horns, too, always attracted attention, they were so long
and shiny. He could run faster, jump higher and butt harder than
any goat he ever met in all his travels, so that wherever Billy went he
very soon became a leader, though he often had to fight before the
other goats found out that they had far better mind than take the
consequences of disobedience.</p>

<p>He was saved from being a bully, conceited and cruel, by a kind
heart and sunny disposition. As soon as he succeeded in establishing
his right to leadership, instead of abusing his power by taking the
best of everything for himself, he would protect and help the weak,
kindly look after the little kids and always see that the old goats were
fed before he ate himself.</p>

<p>It was a sorry day for any dog who bothered the flock when Billy
Whiskers was around. Many a one went howling home after Billy
got through with him. Small boys, too, learned that it was safer and
better not to throw stones in his direction. Probably there are as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
many as twenty of them who have had the awful feeling that comes
of trying to run fast enough to get away from the biggest goat that
almost anybody ever saw, knowing
that he was losing ground
every second, hearing plainer
and plainer every jump of his
pursuer, and the last dreadful
moment just before the shock
came, and then flying through the
air as though fired out of a gun, believing
his end had surely come.
But it never did. Billy Whiskers
looked out for that and
so timed his attacks that he
could land his victim in a
soft place, though he did not
in the least mind if it happened
to be a mud puddle.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-011.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>One day he tossed a particularly
mean boy right on
top of a hedge where he staid
until his yells attracted the attention of the hired man ploughing in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
near-by field who made no haste, Billy noticed, to pull him out of his
prickly nest.</p>

<p>You must not suppose from this description that Billy Whiskers
was a model of good behavior for he certainly was not that. When
he was hungry, he would eat whatever he could get hold of, whether
it was intended for him or not. He preferred a lettuce bed or garden
generally but did not draw the line at eating clothes hung out on the
line to dry, or going into a pantry, no matter whose, and helping himself
to everything in sight.</p>

<p>Of course, tricks of this kind got Billy Whiskers into serious
trouble more than once, but he never said much about it and the
animals at Cloverleaf Farm either didn&#8217;t know or wouldn&#8217;t believe
such stories of their Billy even if they had leaked out and been whispered
around.</p>

<p>Ever since he had been living at Cloverleaf Farm, which is near
Farmersville or &#8220;The Corners,&#8221; as the place was more generally
called, Billy had behaved himself, had stopped stealing things to
eat, had quit fighting, which it must be confessed he dearly loved, and
in less than a year had established himself on the friendliest footing
not only with his master and mistress and all the children, but likewise
with the black cat, the dog, the colt and his mother, as well as the
other horses, the cows and calves and even Big Red, the bull, said to
be very fierce, also the flock of sheep with Old Buck for leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>As was stated at first, Billy Whiskers had found life so pleasant
of late that he had fully made up his mind to stay where he was as
long as he lived. The
work he had to do was
much to his liking. It
consisted mainly in pulling
little Dick around the
place in his express wagon
when Tom or Harry usually
did the driving.
Now and then the drivers
would want to ride, sometimes
both of them, when the
load would be pretty heavy and
more than once, at such times,
Billy was tempted to
run away as he used
to do in his earlier
years, upset his load and smash the wagon all to flinders; but he
stoutly resisted these promptings of rebellion, knowing well by long
experience that it is with goats as it is with boys and girls better to
take things as they come; that it is the hard work now and then, the
giving up to others and readiness to do one&#8217;s share of whatever comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
along that tells whether he is made of the right kind of
stuff.</p>

<p>So things were moving smoothly with Billy Whiskers and he had
no thought of not spending the rest of his life with the Treat family,
when one June day he heard Tom Treat ask Jack Wright, his playmate
and chum, if he were going to the Circus that was coming to
Springfield the next week. Jack said that he had not heard about it.
Tom, who had just returned from The Corners where he had gone on
an errand for his mother, then told him about the show bills that some
men were putting up on the sides of the post office and blacksmith&#8217;s
shop. He said that he had waited so long to see them all that he had
forgotten all about his errand&mdash;he called it his &#8220;old errand&#8221;&mdash;that
his mother was waiting for the baking powder and that he had caught
&#8220;hail Columbia&#8221; when he finally got home.</p>

<p>Jack said that was nothing, it did not hurt when a fellow was
used to it as he was, and that if he had been in Tom&#8217;s place he
wouldn&#8217;t be home yet.</p>

<p>From this you can see what sort of a boy Jack was.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers, who was standing near by at the time, smiled to
himself for only the day before he had both seen and heard Jack
Wright, who was now talking so bravely, spanked for going in swimming
after his mother had told him he mustn&#8217;t because the water was
too cold and likely to make him sick. Jack hadn&#8217;t acted then as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
though it didn&#8217;t hurt. In fact, it had hurt so much and made him
so mad that he had almost decided to run away from home and join
the gipsies who were then camping at the river not far away.</p>

<p>But he hadn&#8217;t gone after all and was now waiting for his friend
Tom to tell him more about the Circus. It made him almost sick
when he thought that very likely his mother might, as further punishment
for his disobedience, not only not let him go to the big Show
but put him to catching potato bugs instead. &#8220;If she does,&#8221; thought
wicked Jack, &#8220;I certainly will run away and never come back.&#8221; He
got some consolation out of imagining how much they would miss
him.</p>

<p>While he was planning this revenge, Tom was talking as fast
as he could and his stories were all the time getting bigger and bigger.
By that time he said that the elephant was as big as the corn barn,
that the giraffe was as tall as the old oak, that the boa-constrictor
could swallow Jeff, the hired man&mdash;he wished in his heart he would,
for Jeff had told his father that Tom had made a mighty poor job of
hoeing corn the day before&mdash;that there were bears and tigers, lions
and hyenas, wolves and wild-cats, ostriches and eagles, and everything
else. He then began to talk about clowns and beautiful lady
horseback riders, Arabian steeds and the wonderful doings of the
trapeze performers.</p>

<p>All the time Billy Whiskers was listening with might and main.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
He had never in all his eventful life been to a circus, didn&#8217;t know
what it was, hadn&#8217;t even heard of such a thing before.</p>

<p>The stories Tom Treat was telling Jack Wright excited him and
the first he knew he had forgotten all about his resolve to never run
away again and had fully made up his mind that come what might
and cost what it would, he, Billy Whiskers, goat, would attend the
Circus at Springfield.</p>

<small>MAKING PREPARATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BILLY WHISKERS had more than a week in which to make
his preparations to go to the Circus. The morning after he
had heard Tom Treat, his young master, telling Jack Wright about
it, he almost decided to give up going.</p>

<p>In the first place he didn&#8217;t know what might happen to him,
and more than once the thought entered his mind that he would be
running into all sorts of danger. You see that Billy was no greenhorn.
He had knocked about a great deal and had been in some
awful tight places. There had even been times when it looked as
though he must pay for some of his escapades with his very life.
Those of you who have known him before this remember his adventures
in the Rocky Mountains and in Old Mexico, and how he was
once lost overboard in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Well,
all of these things tended to make him cautious, so that while he had
been quick to make up his mind to see for himself this wonderful
Circus, he did not finally start on the trip until he had thought it all
over very carefully and counted, as he supposed, the cost. Whether
he had or not we shall see as we go on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>As the first step in making ready, he decided to ask his animal
friends at Cloverleaf Farm to tell him all they knew about circuses,
for, thought he, certainly some of them must know and can just as
well give me pointers as not. He did not propose to tell anyone,
however, not even his best friend, Rex, the colt, what his plans were.</p>

<p>With this scheme in mind, he first approached Abbie, the black
cat. Her real name was Abagail, and while the boys called her Ab
for short, sister Emma and Billy Whiskers always addressed her as
Abbie, &#8220;for,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t so hard a name to pronounce as
Abagail and sounds very much more friendly than just Ab.&#8221; He
knew that it was well worth his while to be on good terms with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abbie,&#8221; he said, when he found her napping the next morning
on the mat before the front door, &#8220;what&#8217;s a circus?&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t move though she heard every word that Billy said.
The truth is she had been very restless the night before and didn&#8217;t
want to be disturbed in her morning snooze. More than that, she
had no idea what a circus was and didn&#8217;t want to let Billy Whiskers
see that she couldn&#8217;t answer his question if it could be helped. Cats,
you remember, have been considered very knowing creatures ever
since the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, and Abbie was very proud
of her race and its reputation and didn&#8217;t propose to lessen it. So she
lay perfectly still when Billy asked her about the circus.</p>

<p>He repeated the question in a louder tone. Still there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
no reply. If his mind had not been so taken up with the matter,
Billy would have known that there was something wrong and gone
elsewhere with his question. But he did not stop to think, he was so
bent and determined on finding out about circuses. So he next, with
more force than he probably intended to use, poked Abbie in the side
with his left horn. Then there was a fuss. She jumped up as
though she had suddenly found herself sleeping on a bumblebee&#8217;s
nest, and the first Billy knew she was looking at him for all the world
as he had seen her look one day at a strange dog which had chased
her into a corner where further flight was no longer possible and
she had turned to fight him off if necessary. Billy Whiskers had
appeared on the scene then just in time to rescue her, but Abbie had
now forgotten all about that debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>There she stood with her front and hind feet close together, her
back all humped up, her fur sticking out so that she looked twice as
big as usual, her tail all swelled up and jerking nervously, while her
eyes looked, as Billy said afterward, as green as old Croaker&#8217;s back.
(Old Croaker was the big frog in the pond behind the great barn.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Abbie,&#8221; exclaimed Billy, &#8220;it&#8217;s me, your old friend.
Don&#8217;t look like that! I only want to ask you what&#8217;s a circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he got a piece of Abbie&#8217;s mind.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-021.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Billy Whiskers, you are no gentleman. If you were, you
wouldn&#8217;t be around here disturbing my rest. You know that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
half dead with neuralgia and that the only sound sleep I get is when
the sun shines on my right side. Now you be off, and if you ever
cut up like this again, you&#8217;ll get a scratching that you can&#8217;t forget
to the last day of your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would probably have kept right on scolding for a long time,
but as soon as Billy Whiskers realized what he had done, he turned
and trotted off without even trying to apologize.</p>

<p>&#8220;She probably don&#8217;t know what a circus is and takes that way
to conceal her ignorance. I&#8217;ll never believe in cats again,&#8221; thought
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Abbie, when Billy disappeared around the corner
of the house, &#8220;he&#8217;s gone and I&#8217;m glad of it. He thinks that I know
all about circuses but wouldn&#8217;t tell him because I was cross at being
disturbed. Wasn&#8217;t that a good one about my neuralgia!&#8221; and Abbie
laughed as cats do, and washed her face.</p>

<p>Billy next asked his best friend and greatest chum, Rex, the
colt; but Rex, who was quite young, owned up at once that he didn&#8217;t
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Whiskers,&#8221; said he, &#8220;how can I be expected to know
about such things when you don&#8217;t? You have been almost everywhere
and I always thought you had seen everything. If you don&#8217;t
know what a circus is, there is no one at Cloverleaf Farm who can
tell you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Some people would have been discouraged by this time, but not
so Billy Whiskers.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask old Polly
Parrot and I don&#8217;t want to one
bit. She will probably laugh
at me, and it is quite as likely as
not she may suspect
my plan and in that
case she will blab it
all over Cloverleaf
and I&#8217;ll find myself
shut up and closely
guarded by Tom
and Harry. While
I don&#8217;t like Polly
Parrot any too well,
I must admit that
she is as sharp as
tacks and if I&#8217;m to
get anything out of
her I shall have to
be very sly when I ask her about the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was just saying these mean things to himself when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
spied Miss Polly out in the grape arbor, swinging and chattering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is my time,&#8221; thought Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Polly Parrot? Nice morning, isn&#8217;t it? You
have no idea how fine you look with the sun shining on your beautiful
feathers. I&#8217;ve always known that you are handsome but you
certainly outshine yourself today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will fetch her,&#8221; thought Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want now, Billy Whiskers? You can&#8217;t fool me
by your soft talk. You are up to some mischief. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy, without replying, beat a hasty retreat, thankful that he
had not asked Polly Parrot outright about circuses.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a suspicious old maid,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t
afford to fool with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy then went to the stable to interview old Gyp, the horse
that was said to have been in the Treat family for nearly thirty
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Whiskers,&#8221; she said, hearing his question, &#8220;I wish I
could tell you about circuses, but I can&#8217;t. My memory is no longer
good. It seems to me that more than twenty years ago I heard a lot
about a circus being in Springfield and a man by the name of Barnum
who was connected with it, but I am not sure and it makes my
head ache to try and recall the circumstances. I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t
help you, and I am afraid that you will not come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
call on me soon again because I am so old and forgetful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There, there, old Gyp, don&#8217;t worry any
more about it. I am sorry I asked you the
question. I know you would gladly tell me
if you could and that&#8217;s kind of you, I am
sure. Of course I am coming to see you
every day. I make few calls that
I enjoy so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this kind speech Billy
left the old horse feeling sure
that she had a good friend in
him. It was by such little kindnesses
as these that Billy made
himself
popular.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-023.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Billy felt
pretty sure
that the big
Newfoundland
dog,
Bob, could
tell him. Of late they had grown to be the greatest friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
though it had seemed for a number of months as if they must always
remain enemies. Billy thought that Bob was jealous of him, and
Bob thought Billy was conceited and vain. But after they had together
saved little Dick Treat from drowning in the swimming hole
down by the wood lot, they had the utmost respect for each other and
were ever after the very best of friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;what&#8217;s a circus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell much about it, Billy Whiskers. When I was living
in the city, a circus came one day. There was immense excitement.
I went early to see the parade. After long waiting, I heard someone
say that the head of the procession was in sight and that the
elephants were leading. I ran right out into the middle of the
street to get a good look. One was enough. I turned and ran,
never stopping until I was safe under the barn at my home. The
head of that procession, the elephant, was the biggest, the most dangerous,
the worst looking beast I ever laid my two eyes on. I hope,
Billy, you may never see one for if you do, your rest will be broken
for months you will have such dreadful nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob fairly shivered as he recalled the elephant to mind.</p>

<p>Billy asked him no more questions for he saw that Bob had told
him all he knew about the subject. He made up his mind that it
would do no good to ask any more of his home friends about it, but
then happened to think of his disreputable acquaintance, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
striped Coon who lived in the big chestnut tree down in the woods,
so he went down to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. Coon was at home and a few knocks on the trunk of the tree
with Billy&#8217;s horns brought him to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Billy Whiskers,&#8221; said the Coon. &#8220;What do you want?
Don&#8217;t you know that this is my time for sleeping?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy did know it for he was aware that Mr. Coon spent his
nights, to a large extent at any rate, in robbing hen roosts. In fact,
their first meeting had been late one evening when Billy had gone to
the garden to select some choice lettuce heads for his own eating, a
thing he wouldn&#8217;t have dared to do in the daylight. (This was before
he had entirely reformed.) He was nibbling away at a great
rate on the finest plant in the whole bed when he was startled not a
little at seeing a strange thing creeping noiselessly along just inside
the garden fence. It seemed to have fur and also feathers.
Just as Billy decided that there was a spook after him and it was
time for him to run for his life, the Coon, for he it was, dropped the
white chicken he was carrying along in his mouth, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Billy Whiskers. I have often seen you at
a distance but have not had the pleasure of making your acquaintance
before. It seems that you, like me, get your living at night. I
think that we ought to be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Billy, what could he say? He did not want to associate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
as a general thing with the Coon who was known to be a thief, but
at the same time he did not see how he could snub him under the
circumstances. So he replied politely to the Coon&#8217;s greeting, and
ever since they had been more or less friendly, though Billy never
told anyone at Cloverleaf Farm that he knew the highwayman and
robber who lived in the old chestnut.</p>

<p>Billy now answered the Coon&#8217;s question by asking another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Coon, what&#8217;s a circus?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was never more surprised in his life than at the effect of his
question on the tough and wicked old Coon, for no sooner had
the word circus passed his lips than the Coon fainted dead away
and dropped down in a limp heap with his head hanging out of the
big knot hole which served as the door of his house. As Billy could
not climb up the trunk of the tree to fan him or dash water in his
face, there was nothing to do but wait for him to revive.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he began to show signs of returning life and finally
pulled himself to his feet again. Billy was then not more astonished
at what he said than at the awful expression on his horrified face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looked,&#8221; as Billy said when he told the story years afterward,
&#8220;as though he had seen forty ghosts with every last one of
them after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Coon began to speak, his voice was so cracked and
squeaky that Billy wouldn&#8217;t have known that the bold old Coon was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
talking had he not seen his jaws wagging. This is what he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;William Whiskers, (he called him &#8216;William&#8217;) never mention
that horrid name to me again. It wakes memories that I cannot
endure. The very thought of them makes me faint and spoils my
appetite for days. Years ago I was captured and sold to a circus
and it was nine horrible months before I was able to escape. Ever
since, the very thought of all I endured makes me weak and sick.
Nights after eating too much, even of the tenderest chicken, I have
the most awful nightmares when I see again those horrid monkeys
who worried me until I was almost crazy. I hated them most of all.
If the time ever comes when I catch a monkey alone, I&#8217;ll make
mince-meat of him if it is the last thing I ever do. But the monkeys
were not all. I can hear yet, in my dreams, the roars of the lions,
the snarling tigers and wild-cats, can see the crowds of people and
feel the canes that were shoved through the bars of my cage and
punched into my ribs, and can hear and see that fool of a clown
saying and doing the same silly things day after day. Oh, it was
awful! It makes me faint to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought he was going to keel over again, but he didn&#8217;t.
Feebly waving his paw in farewell, he slowly withdrew from sight.</p>

<p>The story told by the old Coon made Billy very sober, and again
he wondered if he had better not stay at home and take no risks, for
he said to himself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;What if the circus folks should take it into their heads to capture
me and make me one of their attractions and I should have as
bad a time as the old Coon? I&#8217;d wish then that I had stayed at home
and minded my own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the day spent in fruitless inquiry, he went to bed saying
that he would sleep over the matter and decide later what he had
better do.</p>

<small>BILLY WHISKERS DECIDES</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BILLY awakened from a troubled sleep with doubts and misgivings
in his mind. If the day hadn&#8217;t been fine with everything
and everybody looking bright and cheerful, the chances are that he
would have then and there dismissed all thought of the Circus and
spent the balance of his days in happy though humdrum existence at
Cloverleaf Farm. In that case this story would never have been told.</p>

<p>It so happened that Mrs. Treat, the mother of Tom, Dick and
Harry, wanted some things that morning, and so, after breakfast,
told Tom, who was the eldest of the three, to wash his face and hands
<i>clean</i>, put on his shoes and stockings, and make himself neat and
tidy generally, for she wanted him to go to The Corners to &#8220;transact
some business&#8221; for her.</p>

<p>What she really wanted was a spool of thread, a dozen clothes-pins,
some blueing and two yards of cheese cloth&mdash;just common &#8220;errands&#8221;
as everybody can see. But Mrs. Treat knew how to manage
boys and she was alive to the fact that her son Thomas had rather
&#8220;transact business&#8221; than &#8220;do errands.&#8221; Even so, he made it a condition
of his cheerful going that Harry and Dick be allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
accompany him, the latter in his new express wagon drawn by Billy
Whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may all go,&#8221; said Mrs. Treat, &#8220;but be very careful, and
don&#8217;t stay too long. Keep a close eye on Billy Whiskers. We all
love Billy, and he is certainly the handsomest goat in the county, but
you mustn&#8217;t forget that we are not as well acquainted with his early
history as I wish we were. I have never been able to dismiss the feeling
that there are things in his past that are not to his credit. So you
want to watch out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys promised, though they did not for one minute believe
that Billy Whiskers had not always been the friendly, quiet, peaceable
goat that he now appeared. Mrs. Treat, however, was wiser
and spoke truer than she knew, as this story will show a little later,
though she need not have given herself any anxiety on the present
occasion for little Dick and his new, red wagon. Dick was the dearest,
brown-eyed little chap in the world and everybody loved him,
Billy Whiskers included, who wouldn&#8217;t for anything have any harm
or hurt come to his little master when under his care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Although they had been through breakfast by seven o&#8217;clock, or
a little later, it was nine before the Treat boys were ready to start to
The Corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-032.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE PROCESSION FINALLY MOVED OFF.</p>


<p>Billy looked very scrumptious in his silver-plated harness, newly
polished, especially after he was hitched to the new wagon, marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
in gilt letters on the sides &#8220;Overland Limited,&#8221; with Master Dick
in the seat, reins in hand, but no whip for Billy Whiskers had early
given them to understand that a
whip was worse than useless
where he was concerned.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-033.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The procession finally
moved off with Tom on
one side of Billy and
Harry on the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to keep
this up,&#8221; whispered
Harry, &#8220;until we get
out of mother&#8217;s sight,
and then we can go as
we please.&#8221; Harry
was always called a
&#8220;queer child.&#8221;</p>

<p>At The Corners Billy
Whiskers saw for himself the
wonderful bill posters that Tom
had told Jack Wright about.</p>

<p>The boys spent as much time as they dared looking at them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
which gave Billy a good chance to carefully examine the marvelous
sights.</p>

<p>As all my readers know how circus billboards look and how
much they make one want to go to the show, they will not be surprised
that Billy Whiskers quite forgot the warning of old Mr.
Coon and again decided that he must see for himself these wonderful
animals and astonishing performances that the reading at the bottom
said were but faintly portrayed by the pictures above.</p>

<p>When Billy reached home, having brought little Dick and his
wagon safely through, he lay down to think over once more the
Circus, the difficulties in the way and the fun it promised.</p>

<p>All of a sudden he bethought him of his old friend and fellow-traveller,
Terrence Bull Pup, who, he now remembered, was living in
Springfield where the Circus was to hold forth. Although Billy
had not answered Terrence&#8217;s last letter, having made up his mind to
cut loose from his reckless friends when he came to Cloverleaf to live,
he nevertheless now decided to write to him, telling of his intention to
come to the Circus and ask his advice about a place to stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; thought Billy, &#8220;he&#8217;ll ask me to come and stop with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he wrote and sent in the animal fashion and language the
following well-worded and friendly letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Cloverleaf Farm, June 10th, 1908.</p>

<p>Terrence Bull Pup, Esq.,<br />
<span class="indent">Maiden Lane, Springfield, Ohio.</span><br />
My Dear Friend Terry:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although it has been a long time since you have heard from me,
I am still your true friend and now welcome the prospect of renewing
our old-time acquaintance with the utmost pleasure.</p>

<p>You will be glad to hear that I am well and happy, with a good
home, plenty to eat and surrounded by many friends. I am no
longer the sort of goat you used to know, having turned over a new
leaf on coming here to live. I have given up fighting almost altogether,
very rarely steal things to eat or rob pantries or clothes-lines
now, do but little butting, and, in short, live a peaceable and respectable
life, and try to be a good example to all my friends and neighbors.
I never expected to do anything different but I am hearing so
much about the Circus that is coming to Springfield, and the billboards
that I saw at The Corners this forenoon make it appear so
attractive that I have decided to take it in, and so write to you, my
old friend, to ask if it will be quite convenient for you to have me
for a guest at the time. I not only want to see you, but feel that
your greater familiarity with the ways of the world at present will be
of the greatest help to me in keeping out of danger and in seeing all
the wonderful sights to best advantage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>I trust that this letter finds you well and as handsome as ever.</p>

<p>A prompt reply will be appreciated by</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Faithfully your friend,</span><br />
Billy Whiskers.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good letter,&#8221; said Billy Whiskers, as he read it over
before posting. &#8220;It will bring an invitation all right or I miss my
guess. He can&#8217;t resist that reference to his good looks. Terry always
was vain. As near as I can make out, he considers his pug nose
very cute and attractive and those bow legs of his as models of
grace.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-037.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>When Terrence Bull Pup received Billy Whiskers&#8217; letter he was
of two minds, both pleased and mad.</p>

<p>At first he was inclined to accept Billy&#8217;s words of friendship and
flattery as the true expressions of his warm heart, and write him a
reply with a cordial invitation to come to Springfield at once, stay
for a few days and be his guest at the Circus.</p>

<p>On reading the letter a second time, it occurred to him that Billy
Whiskers might be trying to make use of him and that all his soft
remarks about true friendship and his good looks were just so much
bait with which to catch what he wanted.</p>

<p>He remembered that in the old days Billy Whiskers was in the
habit of thus working his friends, and he also recalled the fact that
his last letter, in which he had suggested joining Billy in his new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
home at Cloverleaf Farm, had never been answered, a neglect on the
part of Billy that cut deep and rankled whenever he thought of it.</p>

<p>More than that, Terrence did not like and had no sympathy with
this talk about turning over a new leaf. Terrence Bull Pup knew
well that HE had turned over no new leaves. In fact, if the truth
must be told, he was now known all up and down Maiden Lane, the
street on which he lived, as &#8220;the terror.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, after looking at
the matter from all sides, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not
be taken in by sly old Billy this time.
If he imagines he can fool me by his
flattery and true friendship dodge
he&#8217;ll find himself greatly mistaken.
Anyhow, his letter gives me a
chance to give him a piece of my
mind straight, and I&#8217;ll just do it,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Springfield, June 12th, 1908.</p>

<p>Dear Bill:</p>

<p>Your letter just received. I can&#8217;t say that I was very pleased to
get it. If you had answered my last letter I might feel different.</p>

<p>Of course, if you come to the city to attend the Circus, I shan&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
run you off when you knock at my door. But my advice to you is to
keep away. You are altogether too good now to go to circuses,
though I well remember the time when you were not good enough.
This talk of yours about turning over new leaves don&#8217;t go with the
writer of this letter one bit. I knew you too well of old, but even if
you think you are better than you used to be, you had best take no
chances of a relapse, but stay where you are, which is the advice of</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your one-time friend,</span><br />
Terry B. P.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Billy, as he finished reading this letter, &#8220;if that
ain&#8217;t the very worst! I must have rubbed his fur the wrong way.
He always was the meanest dog I ever knew. This settles it&mdash;I&#8217;ll
never associate with him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Billy talked big, he had a sneaking feeling all the time
that for once Terrence Bull Pup had the best of him. His conscience
was not altogether clear about not having answered his letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; he wound up, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to that old Circus now if I
never do another thing. I may have a chance to show that dog a
trick or two yet. I&#8217;ll start day after tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">IT was ten miles from Cloverleaf Farm to Springfield so Billy
Whiskers decided to make an early start for he didn&#8217;t want
to miss any of the sights by being late. More than that, he could
get away much easier before the family were up when it would be
necessary to make all kinds of excuses and tell all sorts of fibs, and
even then it was as likely as not that the boys would decide that it
would be safer for him to be locked up all day, which would make
no end of difficulty and delay, even if he finally succeeded in breaking
out and making his escape.</p>

<p>The evening before he went around calling on all his friends.
While he did not actually bid them good-bye, it was afterward remarked
that he had seemed unusually kind and subdued. Polly
Parrot, talking it over with the Plymouth Rock family, said that
she felt sure all the time that there was something up, but she had
never hoped for any such good luck as his clearing out. At which
heartless speech the Plymouth Rocks were greatly scandalized, and
they told Polly, all talking together, that she ought to be ashamed
of herself and that they did not care to associate with her any more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
until she was ready to take back what she had said and apologize.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh,&#8221; said Polly, &#8220;Apologize nothing! He&#8217;ll be back all too
soon. You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; and she laughed like a crazy person.</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-040.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It seems that she had overheard
Billy Whiskers call her a mean old
maid a few days before and had not
yet either forgotten or forgiven that
slight.</p>

<p>All the animals at Cloverleaf, except
Polly Parrot, were deeply grieved
when it was learned on Circus day
morning that Billy Whiskers was nowhere
to be found.</p>

<p>There were all sorts of guesses as to
what had become of him.</p>

<p>Tom and Harry, remembering how interested
he had been in the billboards at The
Corners, at once suspected the truth, and nothing
must do but that their father must take them to Springfield that they
might look for missing Billy.</p>

<p>Mr. Treat, who had been trying to find some good excuse for
going, agreed with the boys very much more readily than they had
expected and told them to be ready to start by eight o&#8217;clock so as not
to miss the parade.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Mrs. Treat, who had said over and over again that Springfield
was too far away for any of them to think of going, when she learned
what preparations were afoot, at once decided that it would not be
safe for them to go without her, and if she went little Dick would
have to go too. So at the appointed time they all started.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers, though he never intended it, was therefore
responsible for his little masters seeing a circus for the first time
in their lives, and he was glad at having been able to do them that
great favor when, in the end, it all came out well.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Billy, who had started a little after four
o&#8217;clock in the morning, was on his way to Springfield, following the
road which he learned by previous inquiry was the shortest and
most direct.</p>

<p>His mind was not entirely at peace for it troubled his conscience
to have thus unceremoniously left behind him the home and friends
where and by whom he had, on the whole, been treated most kindly;
and while it was his good intention to return the following day at
latest, there was an uneasy feeling in his bones that it might be a long
time before he should see Cloverleaf Farm again, but these sad
thoughts and gloomy forebodings were soon outweighed by the excitement
of the journey and the anticipation of the pleasures in
store.</p>

<p>He had gone probably four miles before anything out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
common occurred to disturb his serenity or interfere with his peaceful
progress.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-043.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It is altogether likely that he might have gone on and reached
Springfield by eight o&#8217;clock at latest, in ample time to see not only
the great parade but some of the show cars unload as well, had he not
turned aside to snip a few heads of delicious looking cabbage which
he chanced to spy in a garden at the side of a house he was passing.
Cabbage, you know, is regarded about the finest of all vegetables
by goats, and in this respect Billy Whiskers was no exception to the
rest of his tribe.</p>

<p>So when he saw the beautiful green leaves sparkling with the
dew of the early morning, the temptation was more than he could
resist.</p>

<p>He was eating away at a great rate, having, as he afterward
declared, the time of his life, when, without warning sound, he was
startled nearly out of his wits by the feel of heavy hands suddenly
laying hold of his horns. A voice that sounded to him like the crack
of doom, (that is what he called it when he told the story to his grandchildren
many years later) called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you this time, my beauty, and I&#8217;ll be blest if I don&#8217;t
keep you! You&#8217;ll pay well for stealing in my garden. Come here,
Lige, and help me lock this goat in the barn. He&#8217;s the biggest one
I&#8217;ve ever seen and I can&#8217;t handle him alone. Hurry up! He&#8217;s
getting ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>



<p>Billy was certainly becoming as ugly as he could under the circumstances,
but there was very little chance for him to use his great
strength, and as for butting his captor,
Farmer Grant, none at all,
for he had both Billy&#8217;s horns
in his powerful hands and
was rubbing his nose in the
cabbage or dirt, wherever it
happened to strike, with no
let-up. With the aid
of the hired man called
Lige, Billy was finally pushed
and pulled inside the big
barn door, which was quickly
shut and securely
locked.</p>



<p>Even then Billy
would have made
things lively but his
horns were still held in
that horrible grip, and not until a stout
strap was buckled about his neck and he was tied by a strong rope to
a wagon wheel did the farmer let go, jumping out of harm&#8217;s way at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the same instant, for he already felt no little respect for those long
sharp horns and Billy&#8217;s strong neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave him for the day, and by the time we are back from
the Circus he will be so hungry that we can manage him without
risking our lives. He is certainly the biggest and handsomest goat
I ever saw. I wonder where he comes from. You don&#8217;t suppose,
Lige, that he belongs to the show and has run away? At any rate, he
is mine now and anybody who gets him will have to pay well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Farmer Grant talked on at a great rate as he and Lige were
hitching the span of handsome bay colts to the family surrey preparatory
to going to Springfield for the day. They then went into the
house for breakfast, and at eight o&#8217;clock the whole family had started.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Billy, in the meantime, had been resting and laying his plans.
As soon as he saw that he was fastened by a rope instead of a chain
he began to be hopeful and his spirits rose, though he greatly regretted
the loss of time.</p>

<p>He commenced chewing away at his tether before the Grant
family had driven out of the front gate and never stopped until the
rope fell apart. This took fully half an hour. While he was doing
this, you can imagine his surprise and guilty fear at seeing through
a crack in the side of the barn the whole Treat family driving by.
He hadn&#8217;t expected that they were going to the Circus&mdash;hadn&#8217;t
wanted them to, in fact, for he knew that he would have to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
dodging them if they were there, and he more than suspected that
there would be excitement quite enough without this added anxiety.</p>



<p>But since
they were to
be present, he
was glad that
he had seen
them for
he would
now be on
his guard.
After
cutting the
rope that
held him
with his
sharp
teeth, the
next thing
was to get out
of the barn. This
was no easy matter, and Billy had about decided that it would be
necessary to butt right through the side of it when he discovered a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
small door fastened on the inside by a wooden latch. By raising the
latch with one horn he was able to release and so open the door.</p>

<p>After getting out, he first thought that he would pay off Farmer
Grant for all the mean things he had done to him, but just as he was
about to begin with spoiling his garden, he heard the clock in the
house begin to strike and so stopped to count.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and six miles to go. I haven&#8217;t time now
to do a good job, so I&#8217;ll wait until I come back and then I&#8217;ll fix him
or my name is no longer Billy Whiskers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Billy, little he knew what was in store for him!</p>

<p>He soon found that he could no longer travel in the road. There
were too many people constantly passing, all going toward Springfield,
doubtless to attend the Circus. Almost everybody either called
to him, passed comments on his appearance, or wondered where so
fine a goat could be going all by himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is bad enough,&#8221; thought Billy, &#8220;but it will be worse if
somebody overtakes me who knows who I am. As like as not he
would try to capture me and then my fun would be spoiled. No, the
only thing now to do is to take to the fields. I&#8217;ll get there some
way but it is harder work than I ever thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>He soon found a place where the bars were down, and turned
aside into the fields.</p>

<p>Following along as near to the road as he dared, he made pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
fair progress. Presently he heard whistles begin to blow, and coming
to the top of the hill he was climbing, looked down on the other
side to find the busy little city of
Springfield spread out before
him.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-047.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;It must be noon,&#8221; commented
Billy, &#8220;that&#8217;s why the
whistles are blowing. It will
keep me busy to get to the
show by the time
the performances
begin. The
bills said one
o&#8217;clock sharp.
Way off there to
the south is the big tent. My,
ain&#8217;t it a whopper! I don&#8217;t know how I shall ever get in, but I must
manage it somehow, and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve come. If only Terrence Bull
Pup hadn&#8217;t been so snippy, I would have had no trouble and might
have seen the whole thing. As it is, I&#8217;ve missed the parade. I wish
now that I hadn&#8217;t stopped to eat that cabbage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I see Terrence. If I do, he&#8217;ll soon find I am not so
good yet as to pass over his slights without notice. I can just feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
myself giving him such a butting as he has never had before.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time Billy was trotting down the long hill that leads into
Springfield from the west.
The houses were becoming
thicker and difficulties in going
cross-lots increasing. He
shortly found it necessary
to take to the open streets.
But there were so many
people, and so much excitement
and confusion
that Billy
was a little out of
patience to find
that no attention
was paid to him.</p>

<p>Even the boys,
who had generally
made him trouble
in the old days, now
let him alone.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-048.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>They were on their way home from seeing
the parade where there had been elephants, and camels, and bears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and lions and tigers on view. What was a goat, even as big and proud
and handsome as Billy Whiskers, to sights like these?</p>

<p>Besides all that, most of them were going back to see the performance
as soon as they had had their dinners. No, they had no
time for goats now!</p>

<p>Little they guessed how much of that day&#8217;s excitement and fun
would be due to the great goat they were meeting so carelessly in the
street. If they had, you may be sure they would have looked at him
twice.</p>

<p>At length Billy Whiskers found himself before the great tent.
People were beginning to crowd in. There were hundreds and
thousands of them. The day was hot and the dust stifling. There
was an awful racket and Billy had all he could do to keep from
being trodden under foot.</p>

<p>As he waited, he wondered what he was to do next and almost
wished that he was safely with his dear friends at Cloverleaf Farm.
Finally he made up his mind that as there was no one likely to offer
him a ticket, the only way for him to get inside was to go. So he
made a rush for it right through the opening in the side of the tent,
past the ticket takers, who made a grab at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never touched me!&#8221; shouted Billy. Then he raised his head
to find himself surrounded by such sights as he had never even
dreamed of.</p>

<small>GOING THE ROUNDS</small></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap1" src="images/i-051.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap1">&#8220;MY stars!&#8221; said Billy, as he cast a frightened look around, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t wonder now that my friend Bob ran for his life and hid
under the barn when he saw animals like these coming toward him.
I&#8217;d run too if I could, but I can&#8217;t now. If all these people feel safe
and can have a good time, I guess I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having in a great measure collected his wits by this time, and
his heart no longer beating so that he could scarcely breathe, the
result of the excitement of rushing past the ticket takers, he made a
more careful survey of his surroundings and quickly decided on his
course of action.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-052.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He saw that he was in the section of the great tent devoted to the
wild animals and freaks. As all readers know just how the cages are
placed around the sides of the tent, with the elephants and camels in
the middle; and how the human skeleton, the fat lady, bearded
woman, hairy man, dwarf, giant and such like freaks are seated on
a raised and rickety platform not far from the elephants, we will not
stop to describe the scene that now presented itself to Billy Whiskers&#8217;
wondering gaze. It looked grand to him and he was just as excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
as boys and girls are when they find themselves inside the great tent
with all its wonders spread out before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll first call on the animals and
make friends with those that look
pleasant and answer good-naturedly
the few questions which I
want to ask,&#8221; thought Billy.
&#8220;Then I will go in and see the
Circus that the billboards at The
Corners had so much to say
about, and especially the clown
who makes Tom and Harry
Treat laugh so that they can
never mention him without almost
splitting themselves. I didn&#8217;t
like all the things they said about
him. If he makes those poor
horses race too fast and strikes
people with that board of his that
cracks so, I shall be tempted to give
him a dose of his own medicine. I am
not so meek yet, in spite of what Terrence Bull Pup is pleased to say,
that I can stand it to see horses abused or innocent actors hurt by an
outlandish looking clown.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>What really happened to the clown, owing to Billy, we shall
hear a little later.</p>

<p>So with only the thought to bother him that some member of the
Treat family might spy him and take him out for safe-keeping before
he had seen all the sights, Billy started right in at the cage nearest to
hand. As for the Treats, he knew that there was nothing to do but
take his chances and that they were pretty good considering the great
size of the tent and the thousands of people in it.</p>

<p>As he approached the cage in question, a big one, he discovered
that it contained six or eight animals about the size of his friend Bob,
the dog at Cloverleaf, though not nearly so pleasant to look at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; thought Billy to himself, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that crowd are
where they can&#8217;t get at me. I don&#8217;t like their looks. I&#8217;ll just see
who they are and pass along.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was easier said than done for every one of the group of
prisoners was restlessly pacing up and down, evidently looking for
some way to get out.</p>

<p>It was a minute or two before Billy was able to catch the eye of
one of them for they seemed to never look at anyone, afraid to, in
fact. At length the largest, who seemed bolder than the rest, caught
sight of Billy Whiskers and was so surprised that he stopped short to
take another look. As this was the chance Billy had been waiting
for, he quickly improved it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;How are you?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Do you mind telling me the name
of your interesting and lively family? I am a stranger here and
want to learn all I can. As you see, I am an animal myself and
have none but the friendliest feeling for all our race.&#8221;</p>

<p>This polite speech won for Billy an answer, as he felt sure it
would.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I do?&#8221; snapped the caged beast. &#8220;I&#8217;m most unhappy.
We are wolves. I, myself, came from the boundless steppes of faraway
Russia where I and my people for hundreds of years, have been
wont to roam wild and free and far. We are all robbers and live
by plundering farmers. When quite young, I grew so bold that I
was finally captured alive while eating a sheep I had killed. After
endless travels over land and sea, I arrived in a dreadful place called
New York, and was shortly sold to this show and put into a cage with
these other wretches and ever since we have been a spectacle to
crowds of people day after day. I have no words with which to
tell you, sir goat, how we hate this life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The snarl with which he said these last words was so fierce that
it made Billy fairly shiver.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, the big wolf went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;My companions are no less unhappy than I am, though there
is little in common between us as we have been collected from all
over. There is no quarter of the globe in which branches of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
family do not exist. We never stop trying to find a way to get out,
and if we ever do, we will make some of these cruel people who
have come here to look at us
with never a thought of pity for
our forlorn condition, wish they
had stayed at home. There is
that little rosy-cheeked, brown-eyed
boy with his mother. He&#8217;s
about three years old, I guess, just
the right age to be tender eating.
How I&#8217;d like to get my jaws into his
throat!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-055.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The old wolf smiled wickedly as
he said it.</p>

<p>Billy looked to
see whom he
meant, and to his
horror saw his
own little Dick
holding fast to his
mother&#8217;s hand.
They had passed
within a few feet of Billy, but had not seen him. He was thankful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
for that because he felt that he could never look a member of the
Treat family in the face again if he had been caught hobnobbing with
the great Russian wolf, especially if it ever leaked out what the
wolf had said.</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s nerves were so shaken and he felt so sick after hearing
the dreadful threats the wolf had made that he crept between the
wheels under the cage and lay down behind the wooden side of the
cage which was banked against the far wheels. Here he had time
to recover his composure in peace and pull himself together.</p>

<p>It was not long, of course, before Billy felt well enough to go
on.</p>

<p>Strange to tell, the more he thought of the old wolf&#8217;s story, the
less he blamed him for being so savage. He realized that in picking
out little Dick as the one on whom he would like to wreak his
vengeance, he had not known that he was Billy&#8217;s dearest friend and
that Billy had once risked his own life to save him from drowning
in the old swimming hole, and was more than willing to do so again
if the necessity ever arose. Finally Billy owned to himself if he had
been treated as the wolf had been, captured, taken far from home,
penned up in a narrow cage to be looked at by thousands of people day
after day, year in and year out, with not the faintest hope or chance
of escape, he would feel the same way. The very thought of such a
fate made him quake and wish he had stayed at home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Billy crept out of his hiding-place and slipped quietly past the
next three or four cages without stopping to ask any questions, fearing
that the wolves would see him and make an uproar trying to call him
back to hear more of their sad story and to persuade him to find
some means for their escape. Billy was always tender-hearted when
it came to the cases of those in trouble and suffering, and he knew it
would hurt his feelings to be obliged to disappoint even that pack
of wolves, thieves and robbers though he knew them to be.</p>

<p>By just glancing sidewise at the cages he thus passed and observing
the labels on each he was able to learn the names of the
animals he felt obliged to skip. They were the North American
panther or mountain lion, red deer, wild boar, and hyenas. The
last were such ugly, awkward, unclean and altogether terrifying looking
beasts that Billy did not mind not making their personal acquaintance,
though he would have liked to exchange greetings with
the beautiful, mild-looking, gentle-acting deer; and to have put
a question or two to the mountain lion about his diet. He was
crouched in one corner of his cage and looked for all the world as
though he were ready to spring upon some victim.</p>

<p>The cage before which Billy now stopped was marked in big
gilt letters:</p>

<p class="center">AFRICAN LION, KING OF BEASTS.</p>

<p>Somehow this did not please Billy Whiskers. Though he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
not have admitted it, down deep in his heart he thought that he
himself was probably the king of beasts, and it did not suit him to
see that another was thus publicly given this proud title.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stop and see what he looks like,&#8221; thought Billy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe he is so much after all. If I get the chance I&#8217;ll make him
feel small enough.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-058.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>All this time Billy had not been
able to see the lion on account of
the crowd of people before
his cage. At last he squeezed
to the front row and took
his first look. That
alone would
have been quite
enough to convince
Billy that
he was justly entitled to be called king of beasts, but other proof was
not lacking, for as soon as the great, shaggy-headed lion saw a goat was
gazing at him he was so surprised that he let out a terrific roar.</p>

<p>Even the people were startled and shrank back. As for Billy,
he would certainly have keeled over in a fit of fright had not the
legs of the on-lookers crowded against his sides so tight that he was
held up in spite of himself. His giddiness passed away in a minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
or two, but came near overcoming him a second time when he perceived
that the great lion was addressing his remarks to him.</p>

<p>In telling the story afterward, Billy could never remember exactly
what was said, he was so rattled at the time.</p>

<p>In spite of the lion&#8217;s great voice and savage appearance, Billy
was surprised to find that his remarks were not unkind so far as he
was personally concerned, but perfectly shocking about his captivity,
the sort of life he was obliged to live, the dead meat he had to eat,
the people who looked at him and never once remembered the suffering
he daily endured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little goat,&#8221; roared the lion, &#8220;I wish I could change places
with you. Though I am called king of beasts, I would gladly give
the title and all that goes with it to any free member of the animal
kingdom, little or big, who will exchange his freedom with my captivity.
I came from over the sea. My home is in the wild African
desert where for ages my ancestors have reigned supreme. Boundless
was our kingdom and no one there dared to oppose our will.
My food I got by strength, and stealth, and cunning. Like all my
race, I scorned to eat that which any other had killed. All went
well with me and mine until a strange terror crept over the length
and breadth of our wide domain. I heard the story, and laughed,
when I heard it, that black men from the coast country were coming
to the desert to capture the lions, that they had been bidden to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
this by the king of the Belgians who in some way had cast an evil
spell over them so that they had no choice but to obey his will, that
if they failed of success they were tortured, maimed and even put to
death. It was said that we lions were valuable and could be sold for
much gold and that was why we were wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do I tell you, little goat, all this sad story? Because
I can see that while you are as afraid as death of me, you are still
sorry for me and sympathize with me in my awful sufferings.</p>

<p>&#8220;When about a year old, large and strong for my age, I was
caught in one of the cunning traps set for us. Though my case was a
hopeless one from the first, when the black men came to take me, I
fought as I had never fought before. Two of my captors fell, never
to rise again. With a stroke of my paw I had crushed the skull of
each. Others of them were frightfully mangled and wounded. But
it was all of no use. I was brought to America, sold to this show, and
here I have been ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other things he said Billy Whiskers would never try even
to repeat. They were too dreadful. His one hope seemed to be that
he might some day break out of his cage when a great crowd of
people were before it, spring upon them and kill right and left until
he should feel that he had paid off the score of all his wrongs and
sufferings.</p>

<p>Billy tried to comfort the lion for he was truly sorry for him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
He realized what a magnificent beast he was and what a wretched
life it must be shut up all the time in one little cage. He told him,
however, that it would be wrong for him to visit his wrath on the
innocent people who came to admire him if he ever succeeded in
breaking out, but that he would be justified in dealing with the
wicked king of the Belgians as he saw fit if he were ever able to get his
claws on him.</p>

<p>Billy then sadly said farewell, for although all this conversation
had taken place in the animal language in much less time than it takes
to tell it, he now felt that he must hasten on as there was still much
to see and hear.</p>

<p>Turning about, Billy discovered that the cage of the big African
lion was just opposite the place, near the centre of the tent, where
the elephants were stationed. So Billy went to look at them, hoping
for more cheerful things than the stories of the wolf and lion.</p>

<small>THE ELEPHANT&#8217;S TRUNK</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-063.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was even a larger crowd standing around the elephants
than in front of the lions&#8217; cage. It took Billy a minute or two
to wiggle his way through. While he was doing this as quietly and
gently as he could, for you can well believe that he was on his good
behavior, a little thing happened that came near upsetting all his
calculations and bringing to an untimely end the adventures of this
red letter day at the Circus.</p>

<p>Without in the least intending it, he brushed against the skirts
of a young lady who with her best beau was taking in the sights.
She glanced down to see what the trouble was and, of course, discovered
our Billy. Not knowing him and being very much excited
anyway, she jumped to the conclusion that one of the wild beasts had
escaped and that she was about to be eaten alive. But instead of
running as you or I would have done, she shut her eyes and gave a
little squeal and then tumbled over.</p>

<p>Billy knew that no serious harm had been done and so, instead
of stopping to lend a helping hand, he took advantage of the commotion
to forge ahead and very soon found himself standing close
to the head of the biggest of all the elephants.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Some of my readers know how funny it feels to be right close
up to one of these great beasts. Billy felt the same way, only more
so. He didn&#8217;t dare to move for fear of attracting attention. The
thought passed through his mind that, big as he was, he would not
make more than five or six bites for the monster. He remembered
again the story that Bob had told him of the way he ran and hid when
he saw the elephant marching toward him. He no longer despised
Bob for this and only wished he could do the same thing.</p>

<p>But bye and bye, as nothing seemed to happen, he began to feel
better and to take notice. Then it was that he first discovered the
elephant&#8217;s great trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare,&#8221; said Billy to himself, &#8220;that must be his hitching
strap, and he is loose too, I believe that I will hold on to it till his
keeper comes. That will make me all solid with him. There is
nothing like standing in with the management. Perhaps he will
give me something to eat for I am getting awfully hungry. I hadn&#8217;t
thought of it before but I am. There has been so much going on all
day that I have quite neglected my health. I&#8217;ll be sick tomorrow
when I get home if I am not careful, and then Polly Parrot, as likely
as not, will spread the story all over Cloverleaf Farm that I have been
off on a spree. She is mean enough to do anything, that bird is!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Billy had advanced to the place where the end of
the elephant&#8217;s trunk was dragging on the ground and quick as scat
he had planted his two feet on it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Poor Billy, he little knew what that bit of mistaken kindness
was to cost him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-065.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>To his utter amazement and horror the supposed hitching strap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
began to curl up and before he knew what was happening, the big
elephant had him tight around the waist and he was sailing up
through the air. He had just time to think that he would be dashed
to pieces the next second when he found himself planted firmly and
securely right in the middle of the great elephant&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>What a shout went up! How the boys and girls laughed!
How the people came rushing that way!</p>

<p>In the midst of all the excitement and din, Billy heard first of all,
and it seemed to him louder than all, Tom Treat, who yelled at the
top of his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Harry, it&#8217;s Billy Whiskers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy smoke!&#8221; was all Harry could say in reply, he was so astonished.</p>

<p>Though he was greatly confused and didn&#8217;t yet know where he
was or what had really happened, Billy&#8217;s first thought was that he
must get out of sight quick or that he would be a goner. He looked
about and saw that he was not far from the platform where all the
freaks were, and that it was the only place he could jump and not
light right on top of some of the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest jump I&#8217;ve ever tried but I have got to do it
now and trust to luck. If I once get to that platform, I can scoot
to the other side of it, drop down behind and hide till all the hubbub
blows over. Here goes!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>With that he suddenly pulled himself together in a sort of a
bunch and shot straight out into the air right over the heads of a lot
of astonished people. Tom Treat, when telling his chum, Jack
Wright, about it next day, said that Billy could not have gone further
or faster if he had been fired out of a gun.</p>

<p>Billy imagined that if he were able to reach the platform his
troubles would all be over, but in this he was sadly mistaken.</p>

<p>When the freaks, the human skeleton, the hairy man from Borneo,
the giant, the dwarf, the fat lady and all the rest discovered
Billy on the elephant, they laughed fit to kill and clapped their hands,
but when they saw him coming right at them through the air like a
cannon ball, they were scared enough. The fat lady, who thought
that he must surely hit her, tried to get out of the way all of a sudden.
Of course she could hardly move when she wasn&#8217;t excited.
In trying to be quick about it now, she only succeeded in upsetting
her chair and tumbling over backwards. Down she went
right through the floor of the flimsy old platform, nearly scraping her
sides off. Her sudden upset made all the boards of the floor fly up,
throwing the rest of the freaks every which way, all more or less
in a heap.</p>

<p>On top of them all landed Billy Whiskers. Of course he wasn&#8217;t
hurt, and, as good luck would have it, none of the others were, not
even the fat lady seriously, though she had hysterics and cried and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
laughed by turns and threw her fat arms, which looked like bologna
sausages, wildly about and kept calling on the giant to protect her.
This was after Billy Whiskers, the unwilling cause of all the commotion,
had pulled himself safely out of the wreck and had hidden
completely out of sight in a big empty box which he had luckily found
on the other side, and
quite near the scene of
the great catastrophe.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-068.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll slip in here and
wait till things quiet
down a bit,&#8221; thought
Billy. &#8220;If I try to get
out now the whole
crowd will be after me.
Where there is so much
excitement and so many
things to see, a little
commotion like this
doesn&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was while he was waiting for things to subside that he saw
and heard the queer antics of the fat lady after they had pulled her
out of the hole she had made in the platform. It seemed to the watching
and listening Billy that she was more mad than hurt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Where is that horrid goat?&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;I want to sit
down on him just once for luck. I&#8217;ll teach him to jump at folks like
that! There won&#8217;t be a grease spot left when I get through with him.
Why don&#8217;t some of you bring him to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she began to laugh and cry and toss her fat arms about.
All of a sudden she stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to me, Don Orsino,&#8221; she said to the giant. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to faint and you must hold me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy never could believe that he heard correctly what the big
giant replied, but it sounded to him as though he told her to shut up
and not be a fool, and that she looked like the old scratch and that
she had better look out or she&#8217;d lose her job.</p>

<p>Billy was so indignant that any lady should be treated in such a
manner that he came very near rushing out of his hiding-place and
going for the giant, big as he was, with fire in his eye and head down.</p>

<p>&#8220;One punch, if he didn&#8217;t see me coming, would knock him off
his perch and teach him some manners. I&#8217;ll try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But just then Billy remembered what the fat lady had said about
sitting down on him, and how there wouldn&#8217;t be a grease spot left
when she did, and so he thought better of his rash resolve to go to
her rescue.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for both him and us that he reconsidered for had
he not, this story would have come to a sudden and very flat ending.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Billy, safely stowed away in the big pine box, had time to think
matters over and lay a few plans. Presently he began to laugh to
himself the way the elephant had fixed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very idea of calling that long thing, which I now know
must be his nose, a hitching strap,&#8221; whispered Billy to himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s
enough to make a dog laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>You see that Billy did not even yet know that it was the elephant&#8217;s
trunk, but called it his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the Treat boys hadn&#8217;t been there,&#8221; Billy went on. &#8220;They
will tell everybody at Cloverleaf Farm how it all happened and
Polly Parrot at least will never be through laughing at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy needn&#8217;t have worried over this for it was many a day before
he was to see his friends at Cloverleaf Farm again, and when he
finally returned they were all so glad to see him that nobody, not
even Polly Parrot, for a long time thought of making fun of him.</p>

<p>But I am getting away ahead of my story. There are many adventures
to relate before the memorable home-coming was brought
to pass.</p>

<small>BILLY IN DANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-071.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM his hiding-place in the big box, Billy could look into the
section of the tent where the performances were now going
on, could see the clown in his outlandish dress, hear the shouts of
laughter that followed his remarks, observe the bare-back riding,
and watch the trapeze performers.</p>

<p>He had just about made up his mind that it was safe for him
to start out again when he overheard some talking near at hand that
caused him not only to pause, but to shrink into the smallest space
he could in the darkest corner of his hiding-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you looking for, Mike?&#8221; he heard someone say in a
deep voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That big goat,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Did you see Jumbo put him
on his back? He&#8217;s a beauty. When I saw him make that flying leap
among the freaks, it popped into my head that we ought to annex him
to this show. He&#8217;ll sure make an attraction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know I thought the very same thing, and I have been
looking for him too. It seems to me that he must be hidden in some
of this rubbish. Have you looked in this big box?&#8221; and Mike kicked
with his foot Billy&#8217;s hiding-place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;No, I will in just a minute. But say, before we go any further
let&#8217;s settle it that whether you or I find the goat, we will own
him equally between us. If we decide to
sell him, we&#8217;ll share and share alike.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-072.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m agreed to that. It&#8217;s my guess that
it will take the two of us to handle
and train him. I never saw such a
jump in my born days as he made off
that elephant&#8217;s back. He must
be as strong as an ox. We&#8217;ll
have to starve him down a bit,
probably, before he will be
manageable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. Hurry
up now and see what&#8217;s in that
box. The old man will be calling us
in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go right now,&#8221; thought
Billy, &#8220;for I won&#8217;t be captured by that
precious pair of scamps if I can possibly
help it. As like as not they would want
to put me in a cage, and I haven&#8217;t forgotten what that means if the
stories of the wolf and the lion can be believed. It&#8217;s awfully unlucky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
though, for now I am here there are a whole lot of things I want to
see. The only thing for me to do is the minute one of them stoops
down to look into this box, to jump at him with all my might, knock
him flat, and make a bee line just as fast as I can go for the entrance.
It&#8217;s good-bye Circus for me,&#8221; sighed Billy, and he prepared for the
attack.</p>

<p>For once in this eventful day luck was with him. Just as the
man called Mike was coming around&mdash;Billy could hear him&mdash;where
he could look in at him, someone called and both his pursuers started
on the double quick to get back to their posts, one saying to the other
that they would try it again a little later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saved again!&#8221; Billy would have shouted had he dared to make
any noise, but he didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get out of here now as quick as ever I can for they will
be back in a few minutes. When I am mixed up in the crowd, the
chances are that they will not find me. Even if they do I will be in
no worse fix than if caught in this old box. One thing sure, no man
will ever grab me by the horns again like Farmer Grant did. With
my head free I am not so easy to catch and hold.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this he crept out of his place of concealment and was soon
on the other side of the tent, gazing with all his might at the many
strange animals which the different cages contained.</p>

<p>He stopped to talk with a number of them, but their stories were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
all more or less like those of the wolf and the lion. Every one of
them told Billy that he would be glad to exchange places with him,
and not a few warned him to take care and on no account let any of
the keepers capture him. Whatever else you do, they all agreed, keep
out of this show for it&#8217;s slavery of the very worst kind.</p>

<p>The royal Bengal tiger, who told Billy that his home was in the
jungles of India, made him feel more thankful than any of the others
that he was free and could go and come when and where he
pleased. The things which the tiger said were something awful, and
the savage way he said them made his listener tremble from head to
foot. He felt a special spite, it seemed, against a keeper named Mike,
whom he said he would eat alive without a grain of salt if ever he got
hold of him.</p>

<p>Billy was sure from the name that this Mike was one of the two
men who had come so near finding him, and he was more glad than
before that he had escaped when he learned what a cruel master he
was.</p>

<p>It would be very interesting to describe all the animals Billy
Whiskers saw and tell their stories, but it would take too long and
doubtless the readers of Billy Whiskers&#8217; life and adventures know
about them already. If not, they can all be found in the Natural
History books in the library.</p>

<p>The bears, probably, interested Billy as much, if not more, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
any of the rest. They were very good-natured, especially the young
ones, and seemed very glad to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Billy, who by this time was beginning to be very hungry indeed,
told them how hollow he was, and they said that they would soon fix
him up all right. With that Teddy B. and Teddy G. both began to
push good things to eat through the bars of their cage that fell to the
ground where Billy could get at them. There were apples, cakes,
peanuts and other rich food which people had thrown to the bears
in great abundance.</p>

<p>The crowd of on-lookers when they saw the Teddy Bears feeding
the goat thought it a great joke and laughed at the comical sight.
Billy could hear them saying that they guessed that he was the same
goat the big elephant had put on his back; others were telling their
friends how he had jumped at the fat lady, and then someone said
that he believed that his name must be Billy Whiskers for he had
heard a couple of fine-looking boys inquiring for a runaway goat by
that name. And so it came to pass that many people were beginning
to talk about him, and he felt that he already had good friends in
the crowd.</p>

<p>While it made him proud to hear his little masters called fine-looking,
for he never doubted but that the two boys searching for
him were Tom and Harry Treat, at the same time it put him on his
guard, for after going through so much to see the Circus, he didn&#8217;t
propose to be stopped yet awhile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>If he had only known what was in store for him later, he would
have been glad enough to quit then and there.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-076.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just take a
look at the monkeys
and then go
in and watch the
performers,&#8221; resolved
Billy. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t do not to
have a good look
at them, for ever
since old Mr.
Coon told me his
story I have been
most anxious to
see what monkeys
look like.
I expect they
are dreadful or
the remembrance
of them could not
affect a tough old sinner like
the Coon as it does.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>The monkeys&#8217; cage was very large, and was fitted up with all
sorts of contrivances for exercise. There were a dozen or more monkeys
of all sorts and sizes in it, and they were always one of the greatest
attractions of the whole show and the crowds of people in front
of it were enormous.</p>

<p>Billy had no difficulty in locating it and was very soon watching
the antics of the monkeys with interest. He decided that they were
the strangest looking animals and about the most ugly he had ever
seen, but he couldn&#8217;t make up his mind why it was the Coon had
seemed to hate them so much and at the same time to be so afraid of
them.</p>

<p>He would learn pretty soon.</p>

<p>Like everybody else, Billy soon found himself laughing with
all his might at the funny things the monkeys were doing. They
never seemed to stop for a minute, and around and around they went,
always cutting up some new caper, doing something that nobody
expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;The looks of that old blue-nosed Mandrill is surely enough
to make a dog laugh,&#8221; said giggling Billy, using his favorite expression.</p>

<p>Just about this time, two or three of the monkeys spied Billy
looking and laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that goat,&#8221; said one, &#8220;who made such a smash-up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
freak depot when he jumped off the elephant&#8217;s back. I haven&#8217;t
laughed so hard in a month of Sundays. I wonder if we can&#8217;t make
his acquaintance. I think anybody who can tip over that fat lady is
worth knowing. Ask him, Colonel Mandrill, to come up closer
where we can talk to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Colonel Mandrill did as he was requested and politely
invited Billy to draw near.</p>

<p>At first Billy was shy, but he could see no possible danger, and
the whole group looked so good-natured and jolly that with only a
moment&#8217;s delay he stepped quite close to the door of the cage where
the space between the wires was a little greater than elsewhere.</p>

<p>The monkeys began by asking all about who he was, where he
came from, scarcely giving him any chance to reply. Then they told
him, all talking at once, how pleased they were that he had made such
a confusion among the freaks and how tickled they had been to see
the fat lady, who it seems never had a pleasant word for any of them,
going through the floor.</p>

<p>They began now in whispers to ask Billy if he could not get
them out of their cage and to tell him how everlasting sick they were
of being shut up.</p>

<p>Billy drew nearer so that he could hear better and just started
explaining how impossible it was for him to do anything for them
when, without warning and as quick as a flash, the old blue-faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Mandrill monkey or baboon reached out a long gray arm and
grabbed Billy firmly by his proud whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll either get us out of here or we&#8217;ll pull you in,&#8221; said he.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap1" src="images/i-081.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap1">&#8220;QUIT that,&#8221; shouted Billy, as he pulled and jerked, trying to
break away from the grip that held him fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said old Blue Nose. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you now and
I say to you again, either you get us out of here or in you come if I
have to pull you to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me time to think a minute,&#8221; replied Billy, supposing that
someone would come to his rescue when it was seen what a tight box
he was in.</p>

<p>But the crowd only laughed, not perceiving how serious the situation
really was and regarding it a great joke that the sly old monkey
had succeeded in capturing so neatly the now famous goat. It
happened that none of the keepers were near at the time or they would
have known by past experience that Billy Whiskers was now in great
danger of his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you just one minute to make up your mind whether
or not you care to accept my terms,&#8221; now replied Billy&#8217;s terrible captor.
&#8220;If you free us from our prison, we will make you our leader
and follow you wherever you go,&#8221; went on the monkey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be your leader, dear Colonel Mandrill. I am
not fitted for so distinguished an honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all that Billy could do to make this polite speech. His
voice, in spite of his best effort to control it, shook as though he were
having a chill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You waste good time in talking such nonsense. In half a minute
more you will begin to come between the bars of this cage. By
the time you are all in, you&#8217;ll look as flat as a pancake for the space
is narrow, but I am strong.&#8221; With that heartless remark he gave
Billy&#8217;s head a jerk that seemed as though it would break his neck.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers took a look at the monkey, saw that the thin
gaunt arm which held him was all muscle, as strong as steel. In a
flash it came to him why the old Coon who lived in the big chestnut
at home held the whole monkey tribe in such dread.</p>

<p>&#8220;My only chance,&#8221; thought Billy, &#8220;is to break away from him,
even if I lose all my whiskers in doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, he began to pull back with all his might, throwing
his head up and down, right and left. The strain on his long beard
was more painful than having teeth pulled out, but there was no
help for it. He squirmed and wiggled and twisted. It all did no
good. The strong hand and arm that held him never relaxed. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
long, white, luxuriant beard, once Billy&#8217;s pride and joy but now his
greatest enemy, did not give way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-084.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;QUIT THAT!&#8221; SHOUTED BILLY.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p>He felt that his head was being pulled nearer and nearer the
fatal bars. Now his nose touched the iron, and his fore feet were no
longer on the ground. Billy closed his eyes, throwing his head up
once more, not in the hope of breaking loose&mdash;he had given that up&mdash;but
in utter despair. It saved him. In some way, Billy could never
afterward explain how, one of his horns caught under the pin with
which the door was fastened and as he raised his head for the last
time this pin was dislodged and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s captor was braced against the door at the time, the better
to drag him in, so that when the fastening gave way the door flew
open in a hurry and out popped the blue-nosed Mandrill, followed
closely by all the other monkeys.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-087.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Billy now tried, of course, to get away for he had quite enough
of the monkey tribe by this time, but they wouldn&#8217;t have it that way.
In two seconds they were all around him. Billy Whiskers had set
them free and it was plain to be seen that he was the one of all others
to tie to now.</p>

<p>As soon as the monkeys came piling out of their cage, the people
who were looking on scattered right and left. They made a great
commotion but nobody paid much attention. This clearing of the
space gave just the opportunity that was wanted to organize and
make a few plans. It took far less time than it does to tell it. In a
minute the decision had been reached to give <i>the</i> performance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the afternoon, and so they moved, in a compact body with Billy
Whiskers in the center, toward the great ring, everybody getting
quickly out of their way without being asked.</p>

<p>At the sudden and unexpected appearance of Billy Whiskers
and the monkeys in the midst of the great amphitheatre, packed with
people, a great shout went up. Such a welcome was never given the
most skilled performer or even to the most popular clown.</p>

<p>The reception tendered to the newcomers by the performers and
clown who were busy at the time of their coming with their different
parts was in marked contrast to that of the audience.</p>

<p>They were apparently frightened out of their wits and every
one of them took to his heels, leaving the ring in the possession of
the strangest group that, up to that time, had ever been seen at any
circus, though it became a common sight afterward for the fashion
of a new departure in circus performing was now being thus strangely
set.</p>

<p>Without pausing, the monkeys took up the work of entertaining
the people. It was found afterward, on inquiry, that they had learned
their parts by being able to watch the acting day after day from their
cage.</p>

<p>Some of them mounted the trapeze and gave an exhibition of
daring climbing, swinging, jumping, tight rope walking such as had
never before been seen. Others leaped upon the horses which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
in the ring on their arrival, and dashed around helter skelter, jumping
through rings, leaping from one horse to another while going at
breakneck speed.</p>



<p>The audience, of course, at a sight so novel
and comical went nearly mad with delight. It
was an occasion never forgotten by those
present, the beginning of a boom for the
whole show that made its owners rich
men, for from
that day the
crowds which
came were
bigger than
ever before.
It was not
long before it was
necessary to
introduce
three big
rings in order
that the vast
audiences might be accommodated.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers certainly had no idea what the result would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
when he, as he afterward expressed it, let loose that box of monkeys.
Even when they forced him to go into the ring, calling him their
leader, his only thought was to find some way to shake the whole
caboodle of them and make his escape.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-089.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>But he no sooner perceived the shouts of the people, the hand
clapping, the waving hats and handkerchiefs, saw Mr. and Mrs.
Treat with Tom, Dick and Harry on the third row of seats not far
from the main entrance, and last, but not least to his delight, Terrence
Bull Pup peering enviously at him, his eyes fairly green with jealousy,
from a humble position under one of the front seats to which he
had evidently sneaked entirely unnoticed, than he recognized his opportunity
to make himself famous and resolved to make the most
of it.</p>

<p>The old love of excitement, adventure and mischief burned in
his heart once more as it had not done for a long, long time. He
forgot his rage at old Blue Nose Mandrill who was now dashing
around the ring in a most harum-scarum fashion on the beautiful
white Arabian steed which had been deserted by his regular rider
on the first appearance of Billy Whiskers and his troupe, forgot how
cruelly the old sinner had pulled his beard and threatened to make
him as flat as a pancake by yanking him through the close set bars of
his cage. He thought only of the fact that by strange chance he was
the acknowledged leader of these bold acrobats who were taking
a great audience by storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>



<p>&#8220;Whatever may come of it,&#8221; said Billy, talking to himself of
course, &#8220;now is my chance and I&#8217;ll improve it. These monkeys know
what they are doing and if they
want me to be their leader, I
will. It won&#8217;t do to be too
easy with them. They
have undertaken to amuse
this great audience which
seems pleased with their
efforts and it&#8217;s my part to
keep them at it and up to
the mark. No shirking
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon our Billy stepped
proudly into the center of
the ring. A little while
before he had felt tired
and was beginning to look
bedraggled, especially after
his trying experience
with Colonel Mandrill,
but there were no signs of anything of the sort now. The Treat
boys thought that they had never seen him look so handsome. Terrence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Bull Pup wished as he had never wished anything before in
his life that he had not written that snubbing letter to so famous a
personage.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-090.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Just think,&#8221; he growled, &#8220;I might
be sharing his glory with him if I had
had more sense and decency.&#8221;</p>

<p>No clown ever took the
fancy of a crowd as Billy
Whiskers did now. He
bowed and bowed in every
direction in recognition, as
it seemed, of the great applause
that greeted his
own efforts and those of
his troupe to please the audience.
If any of the monkeys tried to take a rest
Billy was down on him in a minute,
sending him aloft or making him go on
with his hair-raising riding. Old Blue
Nose, who was completely winded, fairly
begged and plead for a breathing spell, but his leader wouldn&#8217;t
hear to it but made him mount his white Arabian and go on with his
trick work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>For fully ten minutes, while the others were performing, Billy
did not give any exhibition of his own high jumping.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll save that to the last,&#8221; he thought. His whole time and
attention were occupied in keeping the others going and in acknowledging
the plaudits of the audience. Finally he jumped over the
back of one of the ponies, then over that of one of the smaller horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must try the big black stallion,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;If I succeed,
we will clear out for we do not want to run this business into the
ground. My, that will be the whale of a jump! I never saw such
a big horse in my life. It won&#8217;t do for me to fall down now. These
ungrateful monkeys would depose me, the Treat family would feel
disgraced, and that snooping Terrence Bull Pup would be tickled to
death. Here goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as he said that, the great black stallion came galloping by.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will never make it,&#8221; shouted the excited and breathless
crowd, for it was plain to be seen what Billy was planning to do.</p>

<p>He jumped high and true, but the spectators were right for
he did not succeed in going over but lighted fair and square right on
the big black&#8217;s back instead.</p>

<p>Nobody but Billy ever knew that he had failed of his purpose.
It looked as though it had been his intention right along to be borne
out of the ring in this proud fashion. Even his band of monkeys
thought so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>The big horse dashed once around the ring with triumphant
Billy on his back bowing his acknowledgements on all sides, and
then down the alley where the performers made their regular exit.</p>

<p>The monkeys, seeing their leader departing, without waiting to
be called, followed in quick pursuit.</p>

<p>What happened then will have to be reserved for our next chapter.</p>

<small>BILLY WHISKERS JOINS THE CIRCUS</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-009.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the show manager saw all the performers and even the
clown come running out of the ring right in the midst of
their fourth act, he was naturally very greatly surprised and excited.</p>

<p>He thought that they had all gone crazy and flew around like
a hen with her head off trying to make them return and go on with
their work.</p>

<p>At last one of them, more composed than the others, made him
understand that something very unusual had happened and that they
did not dare go back into the ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look and see for yourself if you can&#8217;t believe me,&#8221; he finally
said.</p>

<p>So the frantic manager pulled aside the tent flap just in time
to be greeted by the shouts and cheers that the great audience gave
to Billy Whiskers and the monkeys when they saw the astonishing
feats they were performing, as though they were all trained to the
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;That beats me hollow,&#8221; fairly stuttered the flabbergasted manager.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it at all, but I hope I know a good thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
when I see it, and I&#8217;m no judge if this doesn&#8217;t prove the greatest
feature and biggest drawing card the show ever had. The trouble
will be to keep them at it right along. Those monkeys,&#8221; you could see
he didn&#8217;t like the monkeys from
the way he spoke, &#8220;are about as
much to be depended upon as the
east wind. That big goat
seems to make them toe the
mark. I wonder where he
came from and who owns him?
There is one thing certain, this
show from now on has just got to
have him at any price.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-094.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The manager, having satisfied himself
with the way things were going in the
ring, hustled back to make suitable preparations
to receive Billy and his followers
when they had finished their performance and came
out, for he had no doubt but that they would withdraw
in the same manner as regular actors; and in this, as we already
know, he was quite right.</p>

<p>The keepers and handy men were summoned from all sides to be
ready to assist if any attempt at escape should be made. The best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
meal obtainable was hastily collected and temptingly spread out, and
everything possible done to provide for the comfort of the new performers
and to show how greatly pleased the manager was at their
most successful efforts to entertain his audience. He very shrewdly
thought that by this means he could induce them to repeat their act
the next day and for many succeeding days.</p>

<p>It is a question whether or not Billy Whiskers and the monkeys
would have peaceably accepted these terms, but when they finally got
outside the ring they were all so tired from their unusual exertions
that they had no spunk left to go on of themselves, much less to
resist the inviting conditions which they found waiting for them.</p>

<p>As the goat and monkeys had put in their unexpected appearance
at the beginning of the last act of the afternoon&#8217;s performance, when
they withdrew from the ring, the audience, after a great deal of
cheering and repeated bursts of hand-clapping, began to slowly disperse.</p>

<p>The Treat family then held a council of war to decide how they
could best lay hold of their property, Billy Whiskers, and get him
safely back to Cloverleaf Farm. Though not one of them said so,
there was fear in the heart of each that this would be no easy job.</p>

<p>While they felt sure of Billy&#8217;s love for them, especially for little
Dick, they had just seen him in a new and most unexpected role, and
the older members of the family now more than suspected that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
were incidents in Billy&#8217;s earlier history that they had not even guessed
at. They now knew, in fact, that sometime, somewhere, he had been
accustomed to a prominent and public position, that he must have
seen a very great deal of the world for otherwise he could not possibly
have fallen so naturally and gracefully into the trying position of
clown and trick performer when so many thousands of eyes were
looking right at him.</p>

<p>More than that, there was the unspoken fear that the Circus people
might be unwilling to give up a goat who had proven himself
such a wonder and had been the means of making the audience the
most enthusiastic which had ever been in the great tent. They might
hide him and claim that he had disappeared as mysteriously as he
had come, or they might say that he was not Mr. Treat&#8217;s property and
refuse to give him up, or they might try to buy him.</p>

<p>Finally the monkeys had to be considered. It was evident they
regarded Billy Whiskers, whether he liked it or not, as their leader,
and there was no telling what sort of trouble they might make if an
attempt was made to take him away from them.</p>

<p>It was finally decided that the best thing to do, and in fact the
only course open, was for the family to stick together and go in pursuit
of Billy by way of the exit through which he had disappeared on
the back of the great black horse.</p>

<p>Very soon therefore, the jubilant manager of the show was confronted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
by Mr. and Mrs. Treat with Tom, Dick and Harry at their
heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to claim our property,&#8221; began Mr. Treat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy Whiskers, he&#8217;s my goat,&#8221; piped little Dick.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-097.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>As soon as he heard that voice, Billy Whiskers
who was resting near by,
though he had not been seen,
jumped up and rushed to greet
his master. He was so pleased
to see the family that he quite
forgot that he was probably in
disgrace for having run
away and gave every sign of
his great regard for them.</p>

<p>From Billy&#8217;s actions it
was so plain to be seen
that Mr. Treat was
speaking the truth when he
claimed him for his property
that the Circus man, whatever
he might have planned to do
before, did not have the face to question his word. At the same time
he had no intention of surrendering Billy. As the boys were just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
strongly of the opinion that they would not give up their favorite
playmate, it looked for a time as though there would be a deadlock.</p>

<p>But the manager was very cute and he knew by long experience
how to manage people both big and little. Had he not spent long
years in learning how to amuse and please them?</p>

<p>He did not begin by calling Billy Whiskers a good-for-nothing
old goat not worth his salt. No, he said that he was a fine animal,
the most splendid specimen of goathood he had ever seen. This
greatly pleased his owners for they thought the same way about Billy.
Then Mr. Circusman went on to say how fond he already was of him
and how kind he would be to him if he was his property. And so
by easy stages he led up to the plan he had to propose.</p>

<p>He said that he had no idea that they would think of selling the
goat and that he had no thought of trying to buy him, that he would
almost as soon think of trying to buy little Dick himself, but that he
hoped that they would consider allowing Billy to travel with him for
the rest of the season. If they would agree to this Billy would not
only be given the best care in every way, but that he would pay very
handsomely for the use of him besides.</p>

<p>Mr. Treat asked his wife and the boys what they thought of the
plan. While Mrs. Treat, who, you will remember, had always been
a little suspicious of Billy, seemed quite willing to consider it and
wanted to know what Mr. Circusman meant by &#8220;paying handsomely&#8221;
for Billy, the boys took an altogether different view of the case.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Both Tom and Harry said that they did not want to part with
Billy at any price even if it was not for keeps, while Dick set up a
perfect ki-yi at the very thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can once get the boys on my side it will be all right,&#8221;
thought the manager. He turned to one of his men standing near and
told him to go quick and bring the chestnut pony hitched to his wagonette,
but he didn&#8217;t say what he wanted of this gay little turn-out.
The man shortly returned and with him was the chestnut pony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Dick, I&#8217;ll give you this pony, harness, wagon and all if you
will let me take Billy Whiskers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick, however much he loved Billy, could not resist an offer
like this. He had seen this very pony, harnessed as he now stood
before him, in the parade earlier in the day, and he had thought at
the time if he only owned a rig like that he would be the happiest boy
in the world, but it never entered his head that by any possibility he
might have this wish come true.</p>

<p>When the manager saw by Dick&#8217;s smiling face that he was all
right with him, he turned to Tom and Harry and asked them what
they wanted for their share of Billy Whiskers for the rest of the
season.</p>

<p>Tom replied promptly that he wanted a gun and Harry said that
he did too.</p>

<p>This rather startled Mr. Circusman for it did not seem to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
that the boys were big enough to handle a gun safely and he expected
that he was going to have trouble in fixing it up with them. He
talked the matter over with Mr. Treat and soon found that he did not
object to the guns.</p>

<p>It appeared that both boys were very fond of hunting already
and had more than once been caught out with their father&#8217;s old
muzzle-loading rifle, which was known to be dangerous. Being told
not to do this and even punishments failed to put a stop to the practice.
For this reason, doubtless, Mr. Treat welcomed this chance of
getting guns of safest make and best fitted for the hunting small boys
found in the woods near Cloverleaf Farm.</p>

<p>The manager of the Circus, therefore, gave Mr. Treat the money
with which to buy two good guns, one for Tom and one for Harry,
with a handsome sum beside which he said Mr. and Mrs. Treat
were to use in getting themselves a remembrance of this day at the
Circus.</p>

<p>After these arrangements had been made the saddest part of the
whole business took place, namely, bidding Billy Whiskers good-bye.
Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Treat did this without much fuss.
Tom and Harry were so excited about the guns which were to be
bought before they started for home and were so anxious to get to the
gun store that they came near overlooking the fact but for Billy there
would have been no guns to buy. But when they remembered this
they were really grateful and expressed their regret at parting from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
their old playfellow so feelingly that before they knew it all three
of them were in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-102.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;I&#8217;LL GIVE YOU THIS PONY, HARNESS AND WAGON IF<br />
YOU&#8217;LL LET ME HAVE BILLY.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>By far the most touching good-bye was that of little Dick. He
and Billy had been the greatest friends from the first. The big goat
had drawn the red wagon with Dick aboard ever since the little chap
was big enough to sit up. Never once had he run away with him or
spilled him out. More than that, Billy Whiskers and Bob had saved
Dick from drowning, as you remember, when he tumbled off the
bank into the swimming hole down by the wood lot. So when Dick
came to say farewell to Billy it seemed as though he could not let him
go, and the manager was really afraid that Dick would back out of
his bargain or, what was worse, that Billy Whiskers would refuse to
stay behind his little master. But finally Mrs. Treat took matters
in hand and soon effected a parting.</p>

<p>Tom, Dick and Harry climbed into the wagonette behind the
beautiful chestnut pony, now Dick&#8217;s property, and drove away to the
gun store where Mr. Treat promised to meet them and buy the new
guns.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers&#8217; friends at Cloverleaf Farm were astonished that
evening when the boys drove into the yard in their gay rig drawn by
the beautiful pony. They looked in vain for Billy Whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see what this means at once,&#8221; said Abbie, the black
cat, who, in spite of the fact that she had swelled her tail, hunched up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
her back and scolded when Billy had asked her about the Circus, was
at heart very fond of him. She now displayed such gentle manners,
purred so softly and asked questions in such a winning way that she
soon had the whole story from the pony and lost no time in telling it.</p>

<p>The friends of Billy Whiskers held a meeting that same evening
in which each one told of his very high esteem of him. Afterward
resolutions of respect were unanimously passed by a standing vote.</p>

<p>They all acted as though they never expected to see Billy again.
If this was their idea, they were never more mistaken in their lives.</p>

<small>THE KIDNAPPERS FOILED</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-105.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER his friends from Cloverleaf Farm left him, Billy Whiskers
lay down to rest and think matters over. The monkeys,
who had been keeping a sharp eye on him all the time, formed in a
ring around him. They had no idea of letting the friend who had
opened the door of their cage, and whom they had chosen their
leader on the spot get away from them now.</p>

<p>When it looked as though the Treat family might take him back
to Cloverleaf Farm, they had quickly decided among themselves that
if he went they would go too. This, of course, would have led to
no end of trouble and confusion. Just imagine what would have
happened if Billy had returned with such a drab following as that.</p>

<p>At first Billy Whiskers thought that he never could go to sleep
with the monkeys all about him. He was not used to them yet and
still thought that they were the ugliest looking creatures in the world.
He didn&#8217;t want to hurt their feelings by asking them to go away and
give him a little peace. It would never do to offend them now, he
thought, so he just shut his eyes, and as he had a great deal to think
over, soon forgot all about them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;Well, this certainly has been a great day, so far,&#8221; said Billy to
himself. It seemed a very long time since he had stolen away from
home in the early morning, and he ran over quickly in his mind the
events that finally culminated in his unexpectedly finding himself at
the head of a troupe of amazing acrobatic performers, taking a leading
part in the performance of one of the greatest shows on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where am I now?&#8221; went on Billy, still talking to himself.
&#8220;I hardly know yet. The manager evidently thinks because he gave
Dick that pony and treated the rest of the family so handsomely that
I am his property for the rest of the summer. May be I am and may
be I am not. It all depends how I am served and whether or no I
like the business on better acquaintance with it. I&#8217;ll try it for awhile
at any rate. It looks to me now as though I might have a lot of fun
out of it. I have been living pretty quietly at Cloverleaf for a long
time, and I suspect that I am getting rusty and beginning to look more
or less like a farmer. I&#8217;m too young for that yet awhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;This position will give me a chance to see no end of new places.
I can get well acquainted with all the animals, and perhaps I can do
something to make their lives pleasanter&mdash;I will if I can, but I must
be careful never to go as close to any of their cages as I did to the
monkeys&#8217; this afternoon. What if it had been the lion&#8217;s cage instead,
there would be no Billy Whiskers here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The very thought of it made him tremble all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-107.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;And then there is the big elephant. I wonder what he thinks
of me now. I hope he saw me in the ring and knows that I really
do amount to
something. If
not, he must suppose
I am a dunce
for having
thought his trunk
a hitching strap,&#8221;
and Billy giggled
to himself again
at the very remembrance
of that mistake.</p>

<p>With pleasant
thoughts and
plans like these
Billy Whiskers
finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>It did not seem
to him that he had
much more than
closed his eyes when he was aroused by one of the keepers who said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
his helper that it was time to prepare the big goat for the evening performance,
that the manager had said that he was to be given a bath.</p>

<p>At first Billy was far from pleased at being disturbed. He was
still sleepy, and he felt that about the last thing he wanted then was
a bath.</p>

<p>Just at that moment he happened to glance at his right side and
saw how gray with dust he was. He knew too by past experiences
how much good a bath would do him. It was worth more than a
night&#8217;s rest, he had often said. More than that, Billy was very proud
of his appearance, as we all know, and he now felt not a little ashamed
that he had been seen in the ring in the afternoon in such an unkempt
condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they call me handsome with all this dirt on me, what will
they think when I am spick and span?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Billy decided to make no trouble, but to submit to the bath
without a rumpus.</p>

<p>It was lucky he did for otherwise he would have been kidnapped
and there is no telling what might have become of him.</p>

<p>This is the way that it happened. Billy thought that the voice
of the man who awakened him sounded familiar but he couldn&#8217;t remember
at the time where he had heard it before. When his helper
called him Mike he knew in a minute when and where. This was the
very same man who had been looking for him when he was hiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
in the big pine box after creating such a disturbance by jumping off
Jumbo&#8217;s back onto the freaks&#8217; platform.</p>

<p>Not thinking that Billy Whiskers knew enough to understand
what they were saying, they talked freely and made their plans while
his bath was in progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right, Mike, in thinking this big goat a very valuable
piece of property,&#8221; said Jim, for that was the helper&#8217;s name. &#8220;I only
wish we had found him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if we had, and could have hidden him away for a day or
two, we could have sold him to the manager for a big pile of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think of the fun we would have had with three or four
hundred dollars apiece! That pony with his gold-plated harness
and the dandy wagon that the old man gave the little fellow must
have cost all of that, to say nothing of the price of the two guns and
the wad of money for the owner and his wife. It&#8217;s a sorry day for
us when we let this goat slip through our fingers. It almost seems
as though he was our property now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike thought hard for several minutes before answering. A
wicked scheme was shaping itself in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Jim, he is our property, and if you will help me,
we&#8217;ll have him yet. I&#8217;ve thought it all out. It is plain to be seen
that the old man, as you call the manager, expects you and me to take
care of his nibs here and that will give us just the chance we need.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
We won&#8217;t lose any time about it either, for it will be easier to get
away with him now than later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tonight, when we come to load up, instead of putting Billy
Whiskers in a car, we&#8217;ll nail him up in a box and leave him on the
station platform. You and I will stay behind with him. As soon as
the train pulls out, we&#8217;ll take him and start in the other direction.
Later on we can decide what is best to do. Either we can start a
show of our own with Billy Whiskers as the main attraction, or we
can take him to Ringling Brothers and get our own price for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;I&#8217;m with you. It looks good to me. We
are both of us sick of this old show anyway. The Ringlings will hear
about the goat and monkey act and have to put something on to match
it. It&#8217;s lucky for us that they are no further away than Dayton. My
idea is that we had better sell the goat and skip to New York or
Chicago as soon as we can. There is sure to be a row when he is
missed. I don&#8217;t believe these monkeys will act for cold beans when
their leader is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You be around handy tonight to help me box his goatship. He&#8217;ll
probably make no trouble for it&#8217;s all new to him, but whether he
does or not, he&#8217;s got to do as we want and it will be best for us to
work together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at him now! He is a beauty. I wouldn&#8217;t believe that
soap and water could make such a change in him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Yes, and wait until I have combed out his hair and beard and
polished his horns,&#8221; said the now enthusiastic Jim. &#8220;Ringlings will
give a thousand dollars for this goat, or I miss my guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mike and Jim now felt that every good point and new beauty
they found in Billy Whiskers meant just so much more money in their
pockets, you can well see why they took so much trouble to make him
look his best.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Billy Whiskers was considering the new danger
that now confronted him. For several very good reasons he had
no intentions of letting Mike and Jim get away with him.</p>

<p>To begin with, he didn&#8217;t like either of them. More than that,
the Circus manager had paid his friends of Cloverleaf Farm a handsome
sum for allowing Billy to stay with him, and finally, he felt
sure of rich food, kind treatment, constant excitement, growing fame
and a return to his old home at the end of the season. To be sure,
on the other hand, the association with the monkeys was not much
to his liking, but as they felt very grateful to him and were evidently
kindly disposed, Billy knew that he had the upper hands of them and
he felt that as long as that situation lasted he could stand it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do this,&#8221; decided Billy. &#8220;When it comes time to go, I will
make these monkeys insist that I ride with them in their cage. In
the meantime I will tell them all about the danger that threatens me
and fix it up with them that when Mike and Jim try to get me away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
they are all to pitch on to that precious pair of thieves and give them
a lesson that they will not soon forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy laughed softly to himself as he thought of the trouble he
had cooked for his enemies.</p>

<p>There was an hour or more before it came time for Billy and his
band to repeat the performance of the afternoon. He improved it
by telling Colonel Blue Nose Mandrill and the rest of the scheme
that had been hatched to kidnap him, and you can easily believe that
he had no trouble in getting the monkeys to agree to his plan to thwart
it. In fact, Billy had to specially caution them not to go too far.
Colonel Mandrill said right away that he would fix at least one of
them so that he would never try to steal one of his friends again,
while the rest declared that they would see to it that the other did
not escape. They all looked so fierce that Billy thought once more
of old Mr. Coon&#8217;s horror of monkeys, and remembered how he felt
when old Blue Nose had him by the neck and beard and threatened
to pull him into his cage even if he was smashed into a pulp in the
process.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kill them,&#8221; said Billy, in a hurry. &#8220;But you may scare
them out of their wits. They deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see how I feel at the time,&#8221; muttered Colonel Mandrill,
and Billy couldn&#8217;t get any more of a promise out of him than that.
All the rest, however, promised not to go too far.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>By this time the moment had arrived for Billy and the monkeys
to go into the ring.</p>

<p>People who had been present in the afternoon had spread the
news of the astonishing last act. Many of them had returned to see
it a second time, and there was a vast crowd all told, very many of
whom were interested chiefly in it. Under such circumstances, it is
needless to say that the appearance of the goat and his monkeys was
greeted by deafening bursts of applause.</p>

<p>Billy, after his bath, both looked and felt fine. The monkeys,
too, were rested and glad of an opportunity to repeat, with variations,
the feats of the afternoon.</p>

<p>The manager, who had been feeling very nervous for fear that his
new performers could not be depended upon, was vastly relieved at
the way the act started off, and his smiling face soon told how pleased
he was to find that his fears were groundless.</p>

<p>At the end of fifteen minutes, out came Billy on the back of the
big black charger followed by his weary and panting but none the
less happy band. The monkeys did not seem to object in the least to
the fact that Billy worked them almost to death.</p>

<p>If the crowd of spectators had been enthusiastic in the afternoon,
they were vociferous in their applause in the evening. Such cheering
and hand-clapping had never been heard in the big tent before.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; said the manager, talking the matter over with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
treasurer, &#8220;that this will be the biggest money-making season this
show has ever known. Now is the time for us both to ask for a good
big increase in our pay.&#8221; No wonder he was pleased.</p>

<p>Soon all was noise, bustle and confusion. The time had come to
pack up and get aboard the train preparatory to going to the next
city.</p>

<p>The question where and with whom Billy Whiskers was to
ride soon came up for settlement. As he had expected, Mike and
Jim were told to take care of him and see to it that he had the best
of everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put him in a big box by himself for tonight,&#8221; proposed
Mike, &#8220;and after this a place can be fixed for him in the car with the
Shetland ponies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; returned the manager, &#8220;but take care that he goes
through in good shape. I wouldn&#8217;t take ten thousand dollars for that
goat right now. He&#8217;ll be worth ten times that money to this show
before the end of the season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy, who was keenly watching, saw Mike wink at Jim when this
was said. It made him anxious for he knew it would make them more
determined to steal him than ever. During the excitement of the
performance, he had forgotten all about their scheme, but now it came
back to him in a hurry and he wondered if he had been wise in trusting
his personal safety altogether to Colonel Mandrill and his family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-115.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s too late now to make any new plans,&#8221; thought Billy.
&#8220;If the monkeys can&#8217;t save me, I&#8217;m lost to this show. But if Mike
and Jim think that they can do
as they please with me, even if
they succeed in boxing me up
and leaving me on the depot
platform, they are mightily mistaken.
I&#8217;ll show them a thing or two
that they don&#8217;t seem to know. For
a penny, I&#8217;d start in right now. It
seems just as though
it would feel good
and rest my head to
butt into big Mike.&#8221;
But he thought better
of it and resolved
to wait.</p>



<p>By this time the
monkeys&#8217; big cage
was standing ready
for them to get into
it, but not one of them showed any
disposition to take the hint. Mike and Jim, who were given charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
of them also, coaxed and coaxed in vain. Finally one of them
caught Tittlebat Titmouse&mdash;that was the big name of the smallest
monkey&mdash;and put him inside though he resisted with all his tiny
might. But he wouldn&#8217;t stay put. Out he popped as soon as the
hand that held him let him go.</p>

<p>Finally Billy Whiskers jumped in and all the rest followed.</p>

<p>This delay made the monkey cage the last of all to get started.
There was need to hurry. So Mike and Jim decided that they would
put off boxing Billy up until they reached the station. They felt sure
that there would be a chance in the darkness and confusion that there
always was when loading the cars. The box they planned to put
him in was carried to the train on the top of the big cage. Jim drove
to the darkest and most out-of-the-way place he could that they might
the less likely be interrupted in carrying out their wicked scheme.</p>

<p>Pretty soon after the wagon came to a halt, Mike appeared at
the door of the cage. At first he called Billy Whiskers softly, and
seemed greatly pleased to find him laying right by the cage door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes it just as easy as can be,&#8221; Billy heard him say. &#8220;You
open the door, Jim, and I will yank him out. Shut and lock it as
quick as ever you can and then help me, for I may need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may indeed,&#8221; thought Billy. He could just make out to
see that his friends, the monkeys, were wide awake and ready to do
the parts agreed upon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>The bolt was softly withdrawn and the cage door swung noiselessly
open. Mike&#8217;s great arm followed by his head and shoulders
were thrust inside the cage. Billy felt himself firmly grasped about
the waist and in another second he would have been dragged out and
on the ground, but just in the nick of season the long thin arm of
Colonel Mandrill shot out once more, but this time it grasped not
Billy Whiskers but the neck of Mike, the keeper. We already know
from Billy Whiskers&#8217; former experience the terrible strength of old
Blue Nose&#8217;s right arm. Mike was learning it now. He let go Billy
and pulled and tore at the thing that was tightening about his throat.
He would have called to Jim but could make no sound. He tried to
pull away but all in vain.</p>

<p>Jim, of course, very soon discovered that there was something
wrong. He crowded in by the side of Mike to find out what it might
be. Quicker than it takes to tell it, a dozen lean arms, big and little,
had grabbed him wherever they could lay hold, and in two seconds
he was as helpless as Mike.</p>

<p>Billy did not try to interfere for a minute or two. Then he took
matters in hand. He commanded Colonel Blue Nose to let go, but
he did not obey. He ordered the other monkeys to drop Jim, but
they followed old Blue Nose&#8217;s bad example.</p>

<p>Billy was now frightened for the lives of the two men. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
didn&#8217;t want to be responsible for their deaths in such a dreadful way.
He reminded the monkeys that they had chosen him their leader and
once more ordered them to give over their prey. At this Colonel
Mandrill reluctantly obeyed and Mike dropped limp and insensible
at the side of the cage. The others followed the example of old Blue
Nose and Jim fell by the side of his pal in no better condition.</p>

<p>Billy and the monkeys might now have made their escape. They
even spoke of it, but all were of the opinion that they were being
treated too well at the time and the prospects of fun were too good to
think of taking such a step just then. They agreed among themselves
that they might consider the subject later on if things did not go to
suit them.</p>

<p>Presently Mike began to collect his scattered senses. They
laughed in the cage when they heard him grunting and groaning.</p>

<p>Just then he evidently touched Jim who was also coming to, for
they heard them whispering together. It would seem that they were
both thanking their lucky stars that they had escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to give it up,&#8221; Mike was heard to say. &#8220;Those
monkeys are sure holy terrors and they will never surrender the great
goat. I know there&#8217;s big money in him, but he ain&#8217;t for us, Jim,&#8221; and
Jim agreed.</p>

<p>Someone was calling to them to hurry up with the monkey cage
and with more grunting and groaning they got to their feet and drove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
up the inclined plane onto the car. Soon they were rumbling along
to the next place where the great show was to exhibit.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers, in the cage with the monkeys, fell asleep wondering
what the coming days could have in store for him.</p>

<small>THE WRECK</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BILLY WHISKERS was now fairly launched on his career in
the big show that made him more famous than ever before.
From the lordly way he ruled the monkeys he was soon everywhere
known as &#8220;King Billy,&#8221; though he never liked that proud title as well
as plain Billy Whiskers.</p>

<p>It was not long before the billboards were covered with life-size
pictures of himself and his troupe. When he gazed for the
first time in his life, but a short time since, at those wonderful show
pictures at The Corners, he little dreamed that he would ever have
such an honor. The Circus manager was quick to see what a drawing
card Billy was and of course made the very most of it by advertising
him far and wide.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-122.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>On the whole, he liked his new life. The grand parade, on
pleasant mornings, was always a delightful experience.</p>

<p>Looking his very best, he rode on the back of Jumbo, the great
elephant, (Billy and he were soon the best of friends), at the head of
the procession, while his monkey band, who were always imitating
his example when they possibly could, rode on the backs of the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
elephants. How the crowds shouted and cheered and laughed as
they moved by! It
was all music in
Billy&#8217;s ears, and it
seemed to him that
he could never
tire of it.</p>




<p>The afternoon and evening performances furnished two more opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
each day for Billy and the monkeys to show themselves to
vast and always admiring audiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-124.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE RODE ON THE BACK OF JUMBO, THE GREAT ELEPHANT.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>The manager of the Circus was never better pleased than at his
great luck at having secured such an attraction. It was proving, as
he had foretold, the best-paying season in all the long and successful
history of the great Show. For this reason, as one can easily see, he
made things as pleasant as he possibly could for Billy. Both he and
the monkeys were furnished all the time with the things that they
liked best to eat, and nothing was left undone that could add to their
comfort and enjoyment.</p>

<p>The Circusman felt in his bones that King Billy was a very independent
person who might at any time, if things did not go to suit
him, kick out of the traces and there was no telling what might
happen then. The monkeys, without him to lead them, would not
be worth their salt as actors. There had been convincing proof of
this one day when Billy was so sick that he could not lead them into
the ring on account of having eaten too much ice cream with chocolate
dressing the night before.</p>

<p>The audience was so disappointed that there came near being a
riot and a great many demanded their money back.</p>

<p>After that great pains were taken with Billy&#8217;s diet, and his
health was most carefully guarded.</p>

<p>Mike and Jim continued to have the care of Billy. After their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
first experience in trying to kidnap him, described in the last chapter,
they never attempted anything of the sort again. As a matter of fact
they soon became very much attached to their charges and took a
great deal of pride in seeing that they always looked their best, both
when they were on parade and when they entered the ring.</p>

<p>A rival circus sent two desperate characters to try and poison
Billy because he was drawing all the money and their business was
very bad in consequence. Mike caught these two fellows putting
paris green in Billy&#8217;s salad one night. With the help of Jim he held
them both until assistance came and the would-be murderers were
turned over to the police.</p>

<p>When the manager heard of this he complimented the keepers
on their watchfulness and doubled their pay. Billy was grateful to
them too. He forgave the attempt they had made to steal him, and
after that they were always good friends.</p>

<p>During the summer the big Circus visited the large cities and
towns of most of the western states, going as far west as Denver,
Colorado. It then turned eastward once more, and Billy began to
feel that he was homeward bound. This made him very happy, for
he had not forgotten or ceased to love his old friends at Cloverleaf
Farm. While he liked the excitement, high living and luxury of his
present life and had become very good friends both with his keepers
and with many of the wild animals in the cages whose hard lot he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
was always trying to make pleasanter, still they were never to him
quite like home folks.</p>

<p>There was nobody who took the place of little Dick. He knew
by this time that he could never again make so dear a friend. Then
there were old Bob, Abbie (the black cat), the bay colt and other
horses, Big Red, the fierce bull, and his wives, and&mdash;for spice and
variety&mdash;the thievish old Coon down in the big chestnut, not forgetting
Polly Parrot, sharp and snappish though she certainly was.
Billy was beginning to think of them all more and more often, and
the wish to see them and be with them again was growing greater day
by day.</p>

<p>While spending a Sunday in St. Louis late in September, he addressed
a letter to his friend Bob at Cloverleaf Farm.</p>

<p>As it presents very clearly his frame of mind at this time, and
throws many sidelights on his circus life, it is here given in full.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 27, 1908.</p>

<p>Dear Bob and Other Home Friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>I hope that you have not been thinking that because I ran
away to see the Circus at Springfield without saying good-bye to
every one of you I do not care for you. If so, you were never more
mistaken in your lives. It cost me a great deal of pain to do as I
did. You little know how much real grief I felt the evening before
I started when I went around and called on you all. I did not forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
how you had taken me in and befriended me when I was poor and
hungry and sick and lame and alone, nor was I then nor shall I ever
be unmindful of or ungrateful for your great kindness at that time.
No, dear Bob and all the rest of you, you made a friend of Billy
Whiskers then who will be true to you as long as he lives.</p>

<p>Nor must you think that because I have not written to you before
this summer that my new business and friends have driven you out of
my mind for even a little while. How often I think of you all, and
every day I wish more and more that I was with you once again.</p>

<p>As you have no doubt heard, it has been a great time for me. I
wish you could see what I have to do every day. You would be proud
then that Billy Whiskers is one of your acquaintances. They tell me
that I am famous and I judge that such is the case from the way the
crowds cheer every time they see me.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t think that I have become vain and conceited when I tell
you that I was never looking so handsome and distinguished as now.
Owing doubtless to the great quantity of rich food that I eat daily I
have put on more flesh, which improves my figure. Both my hair
and beard are longer, whiter and silkier than ever before, while my
horns and hoofs are manicured daily.</p>

<p>I try not to be proud and stuck up and never lose a chance of
doing a kindness for the wretched wild animals that are shut up in
their cages month after month. Just think how dreadful their lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
must be. I wish I could tell you all about them but I haven&#8217;t time
now. Wait till I am home again, then I shall have many strange
tales to tell about the lions, and tigers, and wolves, and bears, and all
the rest. Some of them are so ferocious that even now the sound of
their deep voices makes me tremble.</p>

<p>Speaking of home reminds me that the time is not now far distant
when I shall be with you once more. Only the thought of it
makes me very happy.</p>

<p>There is just one thing that keeps bothering me. I do not know
how I am ever to get away from the monkeys who have chosen me
their leader and declare that they will never leave me and that I shall
never leave them. While my success in the show business is very
largely due to them and I can have no doubt of their fondness for
me, I may say to you&mdash;but you must never tell it&mdash;that I have
never been able to like them very much. I do not forget the dreadful
fright they gave me at first (it&#8217;s a long story and I can&#8217;t stop to tell it
now) and I just expect they would treat me in the same way again if
they suspected that I thought of leaving them. They are certainly the
worst looking creatures I ever saw, and some of their manners are
little short of disgusting. I shall have to be very sly when the time
comes.</p>

<p>This letter is already too long though I haven&#8217;t told you half of
what I want to.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>I hope that little Dick and the boys are well and that the chestnut
pony has not entirely taken my place in their hearts.</p>

<p>With best love to all,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Sincerely yours,</span><br />

Billy Whiskers.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Keep your eyes peeled and you will see me some bright
morning before long.</p>
</div>

<p>From St. Louis, where Billy Whiskers wrote to his home friends,
the big show moved steadily eastward; by the latter part of October
it was once more in Ohio and not so very far from Farmersville, near
which, you will remember, Cloverleaf Farm is located.</p>

<p>On the night of the thirtieth, when the show train was running
between Hamilton and Zanesville, a head-end collision took place
which threw most of the cars containing the animals off the track and
down an embankment, piling them up one on the other in the utmost
confusion. The frightened and tortured beasts, as well as their keepers,
made the most fearful outcry that was ever heard.</p>

<p>For a long time the people who came to the rescue were afraid
to approach the wreck lest a lion or a tiger or some other man-eating
animal might find his cage burst open and make his escape, killing
and devouring everybody that came in his way.</p>

<p>Fortunately Billy Whiskers and the monkeys were not killed
or badly injured, though terribly shaken up and frightened almost
to death.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>As soon as Billy collected his wits and began to look about,
he discovered that not only was the car in which he was riding
smashed open, but that the jar and up-set had shaken the pin fastening
the door of the big monkey cage out of place so that it was easy
for him to get out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is my time,&#8221; he quickly decided. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do any good
here, and while this racket keeps up I can get away. The monkeys
are too scared and dazed to see what I am up to, and they will not
think of following me now anyway. As good luck will have it, I
am not very far from Cloverleaf Farm, and I know I can find my
way there.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he stole out of the overturned cage and car, picked his way
as noiselessly and quickly as he could through the ruins, and started
on a dead run for the protecting cover of a wood lot which he discovered
not far off. It was not so dark but that he could make out
its faint outline.</p>

<p>All unknown to Billy, there followed behind him a silent procession
of dim and quiet figures, twelve in number. They were
the monkeys pursuing their leader.</p>

<p>When he reached the wood, Billy stopped to rest and to take
stock of his plight, whereabouts and plans.</p>

<p>Like shadows, the monkeys quickly gathered in a circle around
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Now, Billy Whiskers,&#8221; began old Blue Nose in his most dreaded
tone, &#8220;will you please explain to me and my family what you
mean by skipping out with no word to any of your band? While
we may never have told you in so many words, you know very well
what sort of punishment we reserve for a deserter. Speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Billy was startled and had great difficulty in finding
his voice, he was sharp enough to know that his fate now depended
on lulling the suspicions of the monkeys. So he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Mandrill, Tittlebat Titmouse and all the rest of you,
I was never so glad in my life to see anyone as I am you now. I
observe that you have all escaped that frightful wreck unhurt. After
the collision, I was so shaken to pieces and frightened, while the
din was so ear-splitting, without thinking a thing what I was doing,
I started and ran. As you have seen, I stopped just as soon as I
came to a safe place. Before now, if you hadn&#8217;t have come, I should
be on my way back to hunt for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I may be forgiven for that tale,&#8221; added Billy under
his breath.</p>

<p>The older monkeys whispered together for a short time, evidently
trying to decide whether or not this plausible story was to be
believed. Although it was manifest that there was a difference of
opinion, the majority were in favor of accepting the explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
as true and this decision was quickly made known, to Billy&#8217;s great
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been thinking,&#8221; then said Billy, &#8220;that we will never
have a better chance to escape than now. We are not a great many
miles from my dear old home at Cloverleaf Farm which I have
told you about so often. I think I can find the way. If we are
agreed to the plan, I will try and lead you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>This proposal led to another consultation, and while not very
enthusiastic about it, the monkeys shortly said that they would go.</p>

<p>As no time was to be lost, they started north at once, keeping
in the shadow of the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice time I&#8217;ll have introducing this crumby looking crowd
to my friends at Cloverleaf,&#8221; mused Billy. &#8220;I wonder what the
Coon will say,&#8221; and the very thought made him laugh.</p>

<small>HOME AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY this time it was about three o&#8217;clock in the morning. There
were two good hours before daylight, and the time was improved
by travelling as fast as possible. Billy and his party kept
within the woods wherever possible, the monkeys, for the most part,
staying in the trees, leaping from one to another, which is the way
they get about in their native forests. They can travel much faster
that way than on the ground. They all enjoyed the freedom they
were experiencing for the first time in years very greatly, and were
in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>The racket their chattering made was so loud that Billy had to
caution them about it for fear they might attract attention, and this
they did not want to do.</p>

<p>It was easy to imagine what was sure to happen if anyone discovered
that there was a drove of monkeys loose in the woods. The
whole community would be quickly aroused and a big hunt started.
By all means discovery of this sort must be avoided.</p>

<p>As soon as signs of daylight began to appear in the east, Billy
looked about for a good place to hide during the day where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
would all be safe and could rest in peace and quiet until night came
again when the journey could be resumed.</p>

<p>It so happened that they were at this time following the course
of a little river which ran between steep banks of great rocks. Billy&#8217;s
sharp eyes soon detected an opening between two of these large
enough for him to go in, so in he went. To his surprise, this opening
grew in size as he advanced until shortly he found himself in a dark
cave as big as a large room. There couldn&#8217;t have been a better place
for them to spend the day. A little brook ran through the cave so
that the supply of good water was abundant.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen from the bones scattered about that sometime
this cave had been the home of wild animals, probably wolves
or bears, but there were no signs of recent occupation, so Billy was not
disturbed by any fears.</p>

<p>Going out, he hastily summoned the monkeys and told them of
his fortunate discovery of a good hiding-place and bade them to lose
no time in getting out of sight as it would soon be broad daylight.
This they did in a hurry, Colonel Mandrill leading the way.</p>

<p>You might suppose that by this time they must have all been very
hungry and so they would but that on their way during the night,
they had passed through many fields where there was plenty of corn
and pumpkins, through orchards where the boughs of the trees were
bending beneath their weight of beautiful, ripe apples, through cabbage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
patches and fields of turnips. All the time they had helped
themselves to everything they wanted.</p>

<p>If they were not hungry, they were certainly tired. The excitement
of the railroad wreck and the unusual exertions of a two hours&#8217;
tramp were enough to bring weariness to even the youngest and
friskiest of the monkeys. Soon it was quiet in the cave except for the
snoring of Colonel Mandrill who never could sleep quietly.</p>

<p>Evening had come before even Billy Whiskers, who had the
responsibility of the expedition on his hands, roused from his deep,
refreshing slumbers. He supposed from the silence all about him
that all the others were still sleeping. As it was dark in the cave he
could not tell whether it was day or night, so he thought he would slip
out and take a look around when he could decide whether or not it
was safe to start out. With this wise plan in mind, he made his noiseless
way very nearly to the entrance of the cave, when&mdash;for the last
time in this story&mdash;the long arm of Colonel Mandrill darted forth
and nabbed him hard and fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;No you don&#8217;t, Billy Whiskers, for I have caught you again! It&#8217;s
my belief that you have planned to sneak off and leave us here by ourselves.
If I really thought so, I&#8217;d fix you here and now so you could
never play us such a trick again. What have you got to say for
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no such thing,&#8221; answered Billy, mad through and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
at this unjust suspicion, but scared at the same time. &#8220;I was just
going out for a minute to see what time it is. This cave is so dark that
I can&#8217;t tell anything about it. If you don&#8217;t believe me, you can come
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; grimly answered old Blue Nose.</p>

<p>Outside they found that the sun was already down and that it
was fast growing dark.</p>

<p>Billy Whiskers and Colonel Mandrill agreed that it would be
safe to start as soon as the other monkeys were awake and ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;that this little river here is the Tuscarawas.
If so, I know my way and we shall have no difficulty in finding
Cloverleaf Farm. By travelling fast, if we are not stopped or hindered,
we should be there by three or four o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that encouraging prospect before them, they started in
good spirits. In a surprisingly short time it seemed, Billy Whiskers
began to look about for familiar landmarks.</p>

<p>In the distance to the left, he discovered a group of buildings
which he made out to be The Corners where he had first learned
about the Circus and seen the billboards. A little later he saw and
recognized the big chestnut tree where Mr. Coon lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make for that,&#8221; thought Billy. &#8220;If the old marauder is
out and comes home to find a lot of monkeys perched in his tree he&#8217;ll
think he is having the worst nightmare that ever horrified a healthy
coon. How I shall laugh at the sight of him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-140.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">TOM AND HARRY INVITED THEM TO THE HOUSE.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>Billy didn&#8217;t dream of the tragedy he was about to witness.</p>

<p>Soon they had come to the big chestnut tree, and the monkeys,
without being told, quickly climbed into its lofty branches, waiting
for Billy to decide on the next move.</p>

<p>While he was considering how he could best put in his unexpected
appearance at Cloverleaf Farm, he thought he saw two figures
of what seemed to be small boys hiding behind a clump of blackberry
bushes not very far away. They came shortly after he arrived and
evidently did not see either him or the monkeys.</p>

<p>He was right, for Tom and Harry Treat had come out with
their guns to try and get a shot at Mr. Coon, who of late, it seems, had
been very bold and had acquired the very bad habit of robbing the
hen roost at Cloverleaf. Only the night before he had imprudently
selected for his midnight supper the finest young white Leghorn
rooster on the place. This was the more provoking because the boys
had expected to enter this same rooster at the county fair to be held
the next week. The Coon had now gone too far in his depredations
and it was decided to put an end to him at whatever cost of time and
trouble. This explains why they were watching with their guns at
this time of night the old chestnut tree, for it was well known to be
the Coon&#8217;s house.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-142.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Presently a scratching inside the trunk of the tree might have
been heard and very soon the head of the ill-fated Coon appeared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
the door of his house. He crawled lazily out on the great limb near
at hand and was about to scratch himself, as was his wont, when he
espied one of the monkeys. He couldn&#8217;t believe his own eyes, so he
winked hard
and looked
again. Instead
of one,
he now saw a
whole group
of his archenemies here
and there and
everywhere,
all silently
watching him,
Colonel Mandrill
the
nearest to
him of all.
With that he
closed both
eyes and toppled
off the big limb to the ground. Just then two shots rang out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the still air, and at the same time both Tom and Harry rushed forward
to make sure that the Coon did not even yet get away. He was dead.
There could be no doubt of that, but no mark of a bullet was found
upon him. At the unexpected sight of the monkeys, his old and most-dreaded
enemies, he had perished of heart failure.</p>

<p>While the boys were wondering how it was that the Coon had
died while the bullets from neither of their guns had touched him to
their increased amazement and utter astonishment, Billy Whiskers
appeared before them, coming from the other side of the great chestnut
trunk.</p>

<p>On the part of each there was every indication of joy at the unexpected
reunion.</p>

<p>In the meantime the monkeys had climbed down from their
lofty perches and, according to their custom, silently formed a circle
about their leader and his friends. When the boys saw them they
thought that wonders would never cease.</p>

<p>It would be too much to say that they were not a little frightened
at first, but as soon as they saw that Billy Whiskers took it as a
matter of course and recognized who the monkeys were, they invited
them all to come with Billy to the house, assuring them of a cordial
welcome.</p>

<p>On the way, Colonel Mandrill told Billy that the wicked Coon
had doubtless died of heart disease brought on by the sight of him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
his family, and explained that this same Coon had travelled with
their Circus three summers before, that he had been placed in their
cage and that they had no end of fun with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; went on the Colonel, &#8220;the more he hated our teasing
and the crosser he grew, the better we enjoyed the sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, it appeared, &#8220;old ring tail,&#8221; as the monkeys called the
Coon, had made his escape just in time to save himself from nervous
prostration. They had never expected to see him again.</p>

<p>By the time this story was finished, they had reached the barnyard.
It was then between five and six o&#8217;clock of the beautiful October
morning. The animals were just beginning to move about.
Billy Whiskers was so excited that he could hardly contain himself.
The first of his old friends he encountered was old Bob, the big Newfoundland
dog. Their happy greeting was most enthusiastic. Like
wildfire the news spread that Billy Whiskers had come home, and all
his friends rushed to welcome him. They were all present, including
Mr. and Mrs. Treat and little Dick.</p>

<p>What rejoicings there were! Even the monkeys were treated
well on his account, though it must be confessed that it was with
difficulty that aversion and suspicion of them were concealed.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-145.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Mr. Treat said that they would soon learn all about it. In this
he was right for the city paper brought in by the rural delivery man
that day gave a full account of the wrecked railroad train and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
how, in the hubbub, the famous Billy
Whiskers and his trained monkeys
had escaped. In another place there
was a big announcement offering
a reward of twenty-five
hundred dollars for the safe
capture of the runaways.</p>



<p>Mr. Treat, without telling
any of the family, at once
drove to the nearest telegraph
office and wired the manager
that the lost animals were all
safe at Cloverleaf Farm.</p>

<p>The following morning the
Circusman with Mike and
Jim appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>It was soon arranged that
Billy&#8217;s engagement was considered
closed. Owing to the
lateness of the season and the
serious wreck, the show would
at once go into winter quarters.
The only difficulty was to induce the monkeys to go, leaving Billy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
behind. It was finally decided to build on the big lumber wagon a
strong removable cage. When finished, Billy, to whom the scheme
had been explained, jumped in at once and the monkeys followed.
At the other end of the cage two of the bars had been fixed so that
one of them could be dropped down and the other raised up thus making
a hole big enough for Billy to get through.</p>

<p>When all the monkeys were in, Mike and Jim made the opening
for Billy and out he popped before the rest knew what was up. They
then made an awful outcry and tore around like all possessed, but it
did no good.</p>

<p>Billy got out of sight and sound as soon as he could, for though
he did not love the monkeys and they were more mad than sad at
parting with him, still, on the whole, they had had good times together
and been a great help to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel about parting with the monkeys a good deal as I do about
old Mr. Coon. Though I know he richly deserved his fate, it makes
me blue to think about it. It was a disgrace to be an acquaintance of
his, but I can&#8217;t help admitting that he was often entertaining company.
It&#8217;s the same way with the monkeys.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the reward money received for the return of the monkeys
to their owners, Mr. Treat bought one of the automobiles that were
then just beginning to be introduced for use in the country. This
pleased the boys greatly. Beside that he put a thousand dollars away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
to be used for Tom, Dick, and Harry&#8217;s education when they were
older.</p>

<p>And so, for the present, we will leave Billy Whiskers at home
again, more admired and famous than ever before, enjoying as he had
never done in the old days the peace and plenty of Cloverleaf Farm,
surrounded by a host of good friends and many interests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Told with a freshness and vivacity that never fails.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Charleston

<p>Seven boys and as many girls spend a long summer on a

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
